The destiny of [[Arcanoria]] unfolds not through predetermined scripts, but through a living theater of choice and consequence — the [[Fate Stage]]. It is the dynamic framework through which [[World Event]]s and [[Age Crisis]]es are performed, where [[Legend]]s do not audition for roles, but rather grow into them through their actions. Each choice weaves a thread into the score of the [[The Eternal Symphony]], and every role embodied becomes a note in the grand composition of passing [[Ages]].

The [[Fate Stage]] is a theater of emergent narrative, where [[Legend]]s discover their parts through deeds, not selection. It operates on the principle that roles are attracted to those whose actions resonate with their narrative essence. The [[Fate Stage]] unfolds in layers, revealing hidden parts and evolving conflicts as [[Legend]]s make their mark upon the world.

### Roles Embodiment and the Attraction of Destiny

_"A crown is not taken; it is grown into, through the weight of every decision that shapes a king."_

[[Legend]]s do not select a part to play from a list. Instead, they generate [[Story Affinity]] for roles through their decisions and actions during a [[World Event]]. Each role has a [[Role Signature]] — a set of values, choices, and archetypes that resonate with it. When a [[Legend]]'s actions align with that signature, they accumulate [[Story Affinity]].

Then, it is actions that write the script. Every meaningful action during a [[World Event]] generates [[Affinity Points]] toward one or more potential roles. The type and magnitude of affinity are determined by the narrative weight and moral alignment of the choice.

_Example:_ During [[The Hollowing]], publicly denouncing [[Lacrimosa]] generates Defiance [[Affinity Points]] toward the Unbroken Will role which is the [[Savior Protagonist]] role, "good" side, against [[The Hollowing]]. On the contrary, if siding with [[Lacrimosa]] to embrace [[The Hollowing]] and sheltering cult refugees might generate Compassion [[Affinity Points]] towards the [[Purest of Love]] roles, joining as the [[Nemesis]], "villain" side, during [[Age Crisis]].

Not all roles are as straightforward, however. The [[Fate Stage]] has progressive revelation of [[World Event]]s' unfolding drama. The Stage reveals itself through play. Which equates to the fact that not all roles are visible at the start. The [[Fate Stage]] unfolds by [[Act of Fate]], each revealing new roles, complicating existing ones, and introducing hidden characters based on the narrative’s progression.

- Act I: Foundational roles emerge (e.g., False Messiah, Unbroken Will).
- Act II: Complications arise; hidden roles are triggered (e.g., The Betrayer, The Redeemer).
- Act III: Convergence; all roles are revealed, and the final conflict determines the [[World Truth]] for the next Age.

### The Hierarchy of Roles during [[Events]]

_"The play does not reveal its final act until the players have lived through the first."_

Not all [[Events]] feature a diverse cast of roles, these are exclusively for intense [[Ballad]]s during [[World Event]]s, and [[Age Crisis]]. The first time a separation of roles is introduced is during [[The Hollowing]] in [[Ages]] III onwards. Before all roles are [[Major Actor]]s and they aren't noticeable. However, when [[Ballad]]s become more nuanced after [[Lacrimosa]], the following interplay arises:

- [[Major Actor]]: They are center of the storm, a [[Major Actor]] is a [[Legend]] whose choices and embodiment of a role directly determine the outcome of a [[World Event]] or [[Age Crisis]]. There are typically 2–4 [[Major Actor]]s per event, representing the primary opposing forces or central figures. It can be binary of opposing forces or a coalition of several factions fighting for different objectives.

However, to become a [[Major Actor]], a participating [[Legend]] must reach the defining embodiment threshold (20+ [[Story Affinity]]) for a [[Major Actor]] Role. Their decisions during the climax of the [[Events]]' [[Ballad]] have world-altering consequences.

_Example:_ [[The Hollowing]]:

- [[Purest of Love]] Roles:
	- The [[False Moon]]: [[Lacrimosa]].
	- The [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]: [[Selah]], [[Adel]], [[Kaia]], [[Erastus]], [[Seraph]], [[Arioch]], [[Destra]], [[Lucetta]], [[Pagiel]].
	- The [[Purest of Love]] Zealot: Can be [[Civilization]].
	- [[A Pact of a Thousand-Eyes]] Recipient: Can be [[Civilization]].
	- The Hollowed Crown: [[Hollowmarch]], [[Luminaire]].
	
- The Unbroken Will (Anti-Lacrimosa) Roles:
	- [[Opposing the Heavens]]: Can be [[Civilization]].
	- The Auric Stronghold: Can be [[Civilization]].
	- The Pious of the [[Auric Aria]]: Can be [[Civilization]].
	- The Savior of [[Enclave]]s: Can be [[Civilization]].

However, with complicated [[World Event]]s, the secondary roles distinct from [[Major Actor]]s exist, giving texture to the main narrative. These are:

- [[Minor Actor]]: The supporting cast, a [[Minor Actor]] influences subplots, supports or complicates the main narrative, and can, under the right conditions, ascend to become a [[Major Actor]]. There are typically 4–8 [[Minor Actor]]s per event, their threshold is around 5–10 [[Story Affinity]] for a supporting role. They cannot determine the primary outcome, but they can alter its shape, cost, or legacy.

_Example Roles:_ The Opportunist, The Archivist, The Deserter.

- [[Hidden Actor]]: The unexpected turn that isn't visible at the start of a [[World Event]]. It is unlocked through specific narrative triggers, often related to the choices of [[Major Actor]] or [[Minor Actor]]s. [[Hidden Actor]] roles are often game-changers, introducing betrayal, redemption, or revelation. [[Hidden Actor]]s have specific triggers. They may require a [[Legend]] to embody contradictory values or make a sacrifice that fractures their current role.

_Example Triggers:_

- _The Betrayer_: Triggered when a [[Legend]] with high [[Story Affinity]] for the [[Purest of Love]] roles performs an action that harms [[Lacrimosa]]'s cause.
- _The Redeemer_: Triggered when a [[Legend]] saves an enemy at great personal cost.

- [[Transient Actor]]: It is a change during a climax or major moment of truth. Transient roles are temporary complimentary roles, that are a situational part that any [[Legend]] can embody for a brief, critical moment. These roles appear to create additional [[Legend Title]]s, and increase the [[Lyrical Fragment]] generation, any actor can become one of these roles if they appear and they accomplish the conditions required of [[Story Affinity]]. These [[Transient Actor]]s are meant to develop key narrative beats and offer powerful, one-time benefits.

_Example Roles:_ The Sacrifice, The Herald, The Judge, The Last Stand.

### [[Ballad]] Resolution, [[Magnum Opus]]s, and [[Legend Title]]s

_"What is played upon the [[Fate Stage]] becomes etched into [[The Eternal Symphony]]. Every role embodied, every choice made, becomes a law of the new world."_

Acquiring roles during a [[World Event]] gives [[Legend Title]]s based on the degree of participation. While [[Minor Actor]]s are less consuming, so are the rewards, and [[Major Actor]]s require much more involvement in the [[Ballad]] but only [[Major Actor]]s, and a few [[Hidden Actor]]s can create [[Magnum Opus]]s. If there are multiple [[Events]] there are limits to how many [[Legend]]s can be involved in [[Major Actor]] roles, so it's necessary to balance which are the key [[Events]] to participate in if there are multiple concurrent [[Ballad]]s. The rewards are the following:

1. First Embodiment (5–10 [[Story Affinity]]): The [[Legend]] gains the role’s [[Legend Title]] alongside with any minor mechanical benefits they carry. They generate a varied amount of [[Lyrical Fragment]]s according to their decisions, and their rewards aren't as dependent on the outcome.
2. Defining Embodiment (20+ [[Story Affinity]]): The [[Legend]] becomes the primary avatar of that role. Their version of the role influences how it is perceived by others. They gain a [[Magnum Opus]] upon [[Ballad]] resolution with [[Lyrical Fragment]] rewards and multiple [[Legend Title]]s varying in how successfully they were with the objectives of said role. If the role is central, they will always become a [[Major Actor]].

While embodying a role, every action aligned with that role’s theme generates [[Lyrical Fragment]]s of the corresponding type:

| Role Archetype   | Primary Fragment x5                       | Secondary Fragment x3                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Leader           | [[Fragment of Meaning]] ([[Resonance]])   | [[Fragment of Vision]] ([[Crystal]])    |
| Resistor         | [[Fragment of Defiance]] ([[Cindergale]]) | [[Fragment of Acceptance]] ([[Void]])   |
| Scholar          | [[Fragment of Lucidity]] ([[Luminance]])  | [[Fragment of Renewal]] ([[Strand]])    |
| Emotional Core   | [[Fragment of Catharsis]] ([[Flux]])      | [[Fragment of Meaning]] ([[Resonance]]) |
| Sacrificial Lamb | [[Fragment of Acceptance]] ([[Void]])     | [[Fragment of Renewal]] ([[Strand]])    |

There is also some degree of director’s influence, this means that the player, as the ruler of a [[Civilization]], can shape the [[Fate Stage ]]indirectly through

- _Resource Allocation:_ Funding factions makes related roles easier to embody.
- _Policy & Law:_ Edicts create narrative gravity, pulling [[Legend]]s toward certain roles.
- _Strategic Choices:_ Deciding where to send [[Legend]]s, which crises to prioritize, and which alliances to forge steers the collective story, especially with [[Enclave]]s.

Finally, when a [[World Event]] concludes the resolution of its [[Ballad]] there are several effects:

1. Final Embodiment: The [[Legend]] with the highest [[Story Affinity]] for each role is recognized as its primary embodiment and can obtain multiple [[Legend Title]]s depending on their success of the role.
2. [[Legend Opus]]: Each primary embodiment forges a [[Magnum Opus]] for all [[Major Actor]]s, depending on which faction won the [[Ballad]] they receive a hoard of [[Lyrical Fragment]]s equal to the participation of all [[Minor Actor]]s. Some [[Legend Opus]] affect directly rewards with [[World-Bending Relics]] too. [[The Hollowing]] awards the [[Eight-Winged Viola]] for [[Purest of Love]] roles with power directly proportional to how much [[Consciousness]] was merged into it.
3. [[World Truth]]: The primary conflict’s resolution becomes a [[World Truth]] as a permanent structural narrative flavor for the following [[Ages]].
4. [[Age Crisis]] Transition: If the [[World Event]] was an [[Age Crisis]] the outcome can directly lead to [[Golden Age]]s, [[Dark Age]]s or [[Standard Age]]s. It can be modified through [[Era Score]] but it's one of the requirements for [[Age Transition]]s.

**Example: [[The Hollowing]] [[Fate Stage]]**

**Act I:** The Calling after [[A Pact of a Thousand-Eyes]]

- _Available Roles:_ [[False Moon]], [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]], [[Opposing the Heavens]].
- _A cultist performs a miracle_ → +3 [[Purest of Love]] [[Story Affinity]].
- _A scholar negates the true nature of [[Lacrimosa]]_ → +2 [[Opposing the Heavens]] [[Story Affinity]].

**Act II: The Division**

- _[[Hidden Actor]] Role Triggered:_ The Betrayer (when a high-ranking cultist doubts).
- _New Role Emerges:_ The Deserter (as a [[Great Sovereign]] escapes the play).
- _A resistance leader emerges_ → +4 Unbroken Will Affinity.

**Act III: The Revelation**

- _[[Transient Actor]]s appear:_ The Sacrifice, The Judge.
- _Final confrontation_ → [[Major Actor]]s make their defining choices.
- _Resolution:_ The Unbroken Will sacrifices themselves, becoming The Martyr. The [[False Moon]] is debilitated, delaying [[The Birth of the Tetrad Chord]].
- _World Truth:_ “The Martyr’s Seal” – one of the possible martyrs to assign when changing religions has a canonized name.

The [[Fate Stage]] ensures that there is replayability for [[World Event]]s while adding narrative texture as the living mythos is unfolding upon the player. [[Legend]]s are not passengers in a story — they are its authors, and every choice etches a new verse into [[The Eternal Symphony]].
