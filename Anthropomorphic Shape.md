A physical state for [[Outer God]]s and [[The One True God]] to acquire a human-like body.

This is usually done by will through a [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]] or in forced form by a [[Celestial Ensnaring Mirror]]. While being similar to humans in size and shape, they do retain their a portion of their original divine properties albeit directly proportional to their summoning vessels [[Piety]]. 

Developing an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]] is the most effective way for an [[Outer God]] to circumvent the lack of [[Sufficient Precision]] to modify [[Arcanoria]]'s physicality directly without entering a state of [[Static Criticality]].

The [[Auric Aria]] is the only celestial known to surrender her full power before acquiring an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]] due to the exhaustion of weaving her own unique vessel. It takes three [[Cycle]]s for her to recover the strength linked in [[Humanity]]'s [[Piety]].
