### The Girl Left Behind That Changed a God

The memory comes to [[Mira]] in fragments, like trying to reconstruct something from salt and ash.

She remembers a man’s hands—calloused, stained, trembling. She remembers being lifted, and the weight of that lifting. She remembers the smell of sickness and the ocean, mingled together so entirely that she can never separate them.

She remembers the sound of him weeping. But also the sweet sound of a gentle lullaby washed by the waves.

A sickly father—ravaged by a consumption that the healers in the mountain villages had no names for—walked three days down from the high country to reach [[Lune Shallow]]. He did not come for healing. He came because he was dying, and he knew it, and he needed one thing before the end: he needed his daughter to live.

The fisherman who found her on the dock that morning was named [[Kael]]. He was alone—his wife had died in childbirth years before, and he had learned to accept the silence of his home as the price of avoiding the pain of sharing it.

But a child left at the dock, wrapped in cloth, expensive once yet now threadbare, with a letter that simply read: *“Her name is [[Mira]]. Her father is dead. Her mother is dead. Save her. She deserves the world. —A Father’s Last Act”*—a child like that could not be left alone.

[[Kael]] later told people he did not decide to raise her. He just did not choose not to. And by the time he was aware of the decision that had been made, [[Mira]] was already 3 years old and calling him Father.

For most of [[Mira]]'s childhood, [[Lune Shallow]] was a place of relative peace. The Second Wave of the [[Great Plague]] had ravaged many settlements, but it had largely spared the secluded bay. The people said it was because the [[Moon]] watched over them. The people said the [[Lunehymn]] that flowed from the [[Leylines]] here was a blessing.

[[Kael]], however, told [[Mira]] a different story: "We're safe because we're isolated. We're safe because people don't think of us. In a sense, we're only safe because the world forgot we exist."

It was not a story meant to comfort. It was a story meant to teach.

[[Mira]] grew up understanding, from her earliest [[Consciousness]], that safety was conditional. That was the only reason she was alive: someone—a father she would never meet—had taken the risk that a sickly girl abandoned in a safer village had better odds than a dying man's daughter eventually perishing alone in the mountains.

This knowledge lived in her bones.

It made her grateful in a way that some might have called unhealthy. She never complained. She never demanded. She never took for granted that [[Kael]]'s choice to feed her was guaranteed to continue.

She also never forgot.

The fisherman raised her as his father had raised him—with work, with expectation, with the kind of love that is expressed through teaching rather than softness. [[Mira]] learned to mend nets. She learned to read the [[Moon]]'s phases and their effect on the tides. She knew the taste of salt, the color of different depths, the way the harbor changed with the seasons.

But most importantly, she learned to observe the world and its people.

[[Kael]] was a careful man; he had grown cold since the passing of his wife, yet he still kept memory of them, and saw a home in everything [[Mira]] did—in the way she moved, the way she grew. And he recognized that she seemed to carry something heavy even as a child. 

He never asked what it was. But for such, he taught [[Mira]] to notice things in others the same way he saw them in her.

"People are always trying to hide," he would say one day while they mended the nets together, "but if you watch long enough, you can see what they're protecting. And sometimes, if you're with them, they'll let you witness it."

[[Mira]] did not understand what he meant at the time. But those words kept in her mind as much as the sound of the washing waves of the shore.

By age 19, [[Mira]] had begun to understand something about herself: her body was not entirely hers.

She had inherited something from the father she never knew—a weakness in the lungs, a tendency toward persistent coughs, a fragility that made even simple work exhausting. [[Kael]] knew what this meant. He had watched the Second Wave claim people with similar weaknesses.

He did not speak of it.

Instead, he held her hand more often. He sat with her through the nights when her cough was worst. And when she asked him, "Am I going to die as he did?" he did not lie to her.

"Yes," he said with a heavy heart. "Probably. But not today. And that's the only promise anyone has."

It was not cruel, this honesty. It was, in its own way, the most incredible kindness because it allowed [[Mira]] to stop being afraid and start being present to her own life.

She began leaving the house more deliberately, not out of rebellion against her body's limitations, but because she understood—in the way that only someone waiting for their own death can understand—that time was not infinite.

She started spending afternoons in the sick houses.

At first, no one noticed. There were always people coming and going from the places where plague survivors, aging fishermen, and the chronically ill crowded together. [[Mira]], however, began to stay.

She would sit with someone and listen to their breathing. She would count the shallow rises and falls of their chests. She would watch the light in their eyes and, without being told, understand when the end was approaching.

She would not leave before that end came.

By the time [[Mira]] had turned 20, [[Kael]] understood what [[Mira]] was doing before she fully understood it herself.

He recognized it because he had done something similar when his wife was dying. He had sat with her through her final days and understood, with a sort of cruel clarity, that the only thing he could give her was the certainty that when she left, someone would know she had existed.

"You don't have to do this," he told [[Mira]] once, watching her prepare to leave for another evening in the sick houses.

"I know," [[Mira]] replied. "But if I don't, they die alone."

"They're already alone," [[Kael]] said gently. "Death is the ultimate solitude. You can't change that."

[[Mira]] turned to face him. She was still young, but there was something ancient in her eyes—something that had learned too much about loss already.

"No," she said. "But I can change whether it's invisible alone. I can change whether their passing is truly solitary, and if someone has memories of their life."

[[Kael]] looked at his adoptive daughter—this girl he had raised from abandonment, this girl who was slowly becoming luminous with purpose—and he understood what he was seeing: he was watching someone figure out how to make peace with the fact that they are dying.

He said nothing more.

He held her hand and let her go.

The Second Wave of the [[Great Plague]] had truly ended while [[Mira]] was still a child, way before [[Mira]] began her work, but it left scars that never truly healed.

The plague had erased so many families. The song of many bloodlines fell silent. And [[Mira]] learned from the stories of the weeping ill that those who survived had done so partially through luck and partially through the deliberate choice to isolate.

It was hard to be away from others, but the most brutal truth wasn't about minimizing contact but about accepting that loving people in plague times meant watching them die. Some of the survivors had developed a theology about this and the glowing lights in the sky that shine when the night is at its darkest.

They called themselves the followers of the [[Purest of Love]], the devout of the [[Auroral Ribbons]]. Their doctrine was simple: the [[Moon]] that hung above [[Lune Shallow]] was weeping. Something understood loss so intimately that it was trying to send comfort through the only channel available: the [[Lunehymn]], the silvery liquid that flowed from the [[Leylines]].

These pilgrims began collecting [[Lunehymn]], but they weren't carrying it for healing; instead, it was for them a sacred vial in revelation. When the liquid was most concentrated, it shifted from its regular pale silvery shine into a deep, midnight blue, with slight sparkles that mirrored the stars of the cosmos.

In a sense, the liquid was a gaze into the sky, even if it seemed bound to the soil, yet undeniably reflecting the heavens. Its complexity was truly mesmerizing.

They would drink it and fall into dreams so vivid and directed that it was almost like receiving visits from a [[Consciousness]] so large and so sad that it could only communicate through the language of dreams.

In these dreams, the devout began to understand something: whatever it was in the [[Moon]] was not looking for worship. It was looking for understanding. It was almost as if it was trying to explain what it is to be frail, imprisoned, but essential to the untouched. Even in their own fragility, they still choose to pour love into a world that could not return it. It was **"A love so pure it doesn't require love."**

The pilgrims not only saw the [[Auroral Ribbons]]. They also watched [[Mira]].

They saw a girl who had been left behind as a child, raised by someone else's mercy, slowly dying from the frailty of their condition, yet even in her weakness, she chose to spend her evenings comforting the endings of others that could not prevent their own death.

And they understood that [[Mira]] was already doing what the [[Moon]] had been trying to do. They understood that [[Mira]] was the living answer to the [[Moon]] weeping dreams.

However, not everything would always be so beautiful.

Two years went by, and finally the devastating yet silent Third Wave of the [[Great Plague]] came. It did not announce itself until it had already begun.

A fisherman coughs at the market. A child develops a fever. A wife wakes to find her husband struggling for breath. Within days, even the carefully maintained isolation that [[Lune Shallow]] had relied on for safety since the start of [[Worldbuilding/Rise & Fall, Crisis/Crisis/Great Plague]] shatters.

The [[Great Plague]] arrives with the spring tides, carried perhaps by traders from outside, or by the simple inevitability of disease finding every hiding place eventually.

[[Kael]] is not young. He is 57 years old, and decades of work on the water had weathered his body. His lungs are already compromised and strained from constant exposure to salt air and harsh labor.

He knows, when he first begins to cough, precisely what is happening.

He does not tell [[Mira]] immediately.

Instead, he continues to rise at dawn. He continues to prepare to go to the boats. He does all the small rituals of normalcy for three days before [[Mira]] realizes. One morning, she finds him collapsed in the kitchen, coughing blood onto the floor. And the conversation that follows is the most important conversation of her life.

[[Mira]] kneels beside her father and does not weep. She has learned that weeping accomplishes nothing.

Instead, she asks: "How long have you known?"

[[Kael]] looks at his daughter—this woman who has grown from an abandoned child into someone luminous with purpose—and he tells her the truth.

"Since the first cough. I've lived long enough to recognize my own ending."

[[Mira]] helps him to bed. She brings him water. She sits beside him and does the thing she has learned to do: she stays with him as he passes, slow yet sure.

"I'm sorry," [[Kael]] says after a long silence with the first tears that [[Mira]] has ever seen in him. "I'm sorry I have to leave you again. I know what abandonment is like. I know what it does to you."

[[Mira]] takes his hand. Her grip is steady, even though her body is betraying her too, even though she knows she will not be far behind him.

"You didn't abandon me the first time," she says. "You saved me. And you're not abandoning me now. You're dying. There's a difference."

"Is there?" [[Kael]] asks, with a genuine uncertainty in his voice. "From where you're standing, does it feel different?"

[[Mira]] considers this with absolute honesty.

"No," she finally says. "It feels like losing everything. But at least this time, I understand that it has to happen. The first time, I didn't even understand what was being taken from me."

[[Kael]]'s breathing becomes more labored as the days pass.

He declines rapidly—faster than the typical progression, as if his body is in a hurry to leave. Within a week, he is barely conscious. Within ten days, his breathing is shallow and irregular.

[[Mira]] sits with him constantly.

She barely sleeps. She does not leave home. But she does what she has learned to do with everyone else: she witnesses [[Kael]]’s final moments, tending to his care.

But this time, it is different.

This time, she is not a stranger offering presence to someone she has just met. This time, she is a daughter holding the hand of the man who chose to raise her, who decided to love her despite knowing it would end exactly this way.

Then her dreaded night finally arrives: a night when the moon is dark—a new moon, a phase when the [[Lunehymn]] does not flow, when the [[Leylines]] are quieter, when [[Arcanoria]] itself seems to hold its breath.

[[Kael]]'s breathing becomes something else entirely.

It becomes the breathing of someone whose lungs have filled with despair, whose body is drowning in its own failure.

[[Mira]] holds his hand and counts the moments between gasps. 

She watches the light in his eyes begin to dim.

And when the moment comes—that precise, countable moment where he stops being someone struggling to breathe and becomes someone who has stopped breathing—[[Mira]] is present.

She sees it. She is the one witness clinging to his deathbed. She is the last in this world to register that [[Kael]] exists, before his existence becomes her memory.

And then she is alone in the house they have shared for over 2 decades, and the weight of that loneliness pierces her heart in a pain that her own sickness could never even compare.

It is not the aloneness of a child whose father had abandoned them. It is the aloneness of someone who has loved someone and watched them depart, and now must choose what to do with the absence they leave behind.

For two days after [[Kael]]'s death, [[Mira]] holds still. She is still clinging to him. In the exact position of her clenched heart, she does not eat or sleep.

She sits in the house and feels the weight of every ending she has ever witnessed, compressed now into her own body, her own loss.

She understands, for the first time, that witnessing the deaths of strangers was practice. It was preparation. But nothing—nothing—prepares you for seeing someone you love.

She understands that this is a wound that will not close. That she will carry [[Kael]]'s absence for the rest of her life, even if that too is increasingly limited.

On the third day—still without sleep—[[Mira]]'s body finally passes out from exhaustion. 

She dreams of her father, desperately running, yet composed in singing her a lullaby. She never forgot the melody, even if fog deeply clouded the memory. The sweetness of it made her solitude bearable, even if the only truth she knew of her home was the harmony of it.

When she woke up, she was curled on the floor. She had a burning feeling in her eyes from crying in her sleep, but her hands were clenching a small, teardrop gem, appearing as if it had always been there, waiting for her to break open enough to find it.

It was pulsing with her heartbeat in a beautiful midnight purple, fading through a fine veinwork of black branches. She just had her [[Motif Awakening]] to [[Void]], the element of absence itself, in the dark hues of the space that is no longer there.

She does not understand what has happened—that the intensity of her grief has crystallized her [[Consciousness]] into the one binding that could hold it: the power to thread emptiness as deeply as presence. 

She carefully holds the gem in her trembling hands and understands one thing: the absence is absolute now. And this gem, her [[Soul Leitmotif]] humming with the sweet lullaby of her bygone memory, is proof that [[Kael]] existed, that her orphaned family existed, because something in [[Mira]] broke when they all left her behind.

She sits on the floor with the gem in her palms and rocks back and forth, not weeping now, but in a state beyond weeping. In shock. In sleeplessness. In a hunger so profound it has stopped hurting and become a kind of hollow feeling.

She fidgets with the gem endlessly, her fingers tracing its curves, feeling its warmth—the pulsing of her own heartbeat, crystallized, made tangible.

"This is proof," she whispers to no one, to everyone, to the absence itself. "This is proof I loved. This is proof that they were all real."

Later that day, once a full [[Moon]] is clear in the sky, there is a knock on the door.

It is [[Selah]], the leader of the pilgrims following the [[Auroral Ribbons]].

[[Selah]] enters through the unlocked door and sees immediately that [[Mira]] is destroyed. She is breaking. She has barely slept, not eaten, and she is clutching something that glows faintly in the shadows of her clenched hand  —her newly awakened [[Soul Leitmotif]], her grief made [[Crystal]].

[[Mira]]'s eyes are hollow. Her skin has taken on a translucent quality. She looks like someone who is already halfway between the world and whatever comes after.

[[Selah]] kneels beside her and does something unexpected: she does not offer comfort or solutions. Instead, she reaches out and gently opens [[Mira]]'s clenched fist.

The [[Void]] gem rests there, pulsing softly.

[[Selah]] understands what she is seeing immediately. "You've awakened," [[Selah]] says, and filled her voice with something like awe. "You've awakened a [[Void]] binding. That means—"

"It means he's gone," [[Mira]] interrupts, her voice paper-thin. "It means they are all gone, and that absence is real. It means I'm proof that he existed because something in me broke when he left."

[[Selah]] sits with her. She sits in the destruction and says, "He was good. And he's gone. And you loved him. And that doesn't make it better."

For the first time in her life, [[Mira]] truly breaks. She lets herself cry in all of her profound feelings. [[Selah]] embraces her.

For hours, she cries while [[Selah]] tends to her decaying body. She cries for the father she never met, for the fisherman who raised her, for every person she's ever sat with in their final moments, for herself, and the days she has left.

And as she cries, something else happens.

The [[Auroral Ribbons]] begin to shimmer in the window with the light of the people who had passed that night. Not faintly, as they usually do. But visibly, actively, almost as if responding to her grief with their own kind of luminescence.

[[Selah]] prays to them. And as she does, she understands that [[Mira]]'s grief is the light in her darkest night. She is the chosen of the [[Moon]].

When [[Mira]]'s weeping finally subdues, [[Selah]] speaks.

"We've been watching you. For two years, we've been watching you sit with the dying and offer presence. And we've been understanding something. The [[Lunehymn]] that flows here—it's not just a healing agent. It's a form of communication. Something in the [[Moon]] is trying to reach us. And every time you sit with someone while they die, every time you witness an ending, you're answering that call."

[[Mira]] looks at her with broken, flooded eyes, utterly human in their vulnerability.

"What are you asking?" [[Mira]] says, though she begins to suspect.

Sera takes a long breath. "There's something vast watching you. Something lonely. And I think it's grieving too—for something or someone we can't see. The [[Auroral Ribbons]] shimmer brighter when you're near the dying. It's like the [[Moon]] itself is trying to speak through you."

She pauses carefully.

"We want to ask if you would be willing to transform that grief into something larger. If you would be willing to let what you're carrying right now—this awakening, this presence, this understanding of what it means to witness absence—become something that reaches everyone."

[[Mira]] looks down at the [[Void]] gem in her hand.

"How?" she asks.

"We don't know," [[Selah]] admits while looking out the window. "We've never done this. But we believe that if we create the right conditions—if we gather people who understand grief, who understand presence—then the thing watching from the [[Moon]] might step forward. And if you were willing to meet it..."

[[Selah]] trails off, letting the implication sit.

[[Mira]] understands what [[Selah]] is really asking: "Would you be willing to die in a way that matters? Would you be willing to let your [[Consciousness]]—the part of you that is always present in passing—become something larger?"

"It's lonely," [[Mira]] says quietly pointing to the [[Moon]]. It is not a question.

"Infinitely," [[Selah]] confirms.

[[Mira]] closes her fist around the gem. It warms in her palm, pulsing with her [[Consciousness]].

"Then yes," she says. "But not to be healed. And not to save anyone."

"Why, then?" [[Selah]] asks.

"Because if I can use my death to make something lonely into something less lonely, then at least my life will have meant something. At least everyone I've lost will continue in me, in the memory of whatever I become." [[Mira]] pauses, looking to the glow of the [[Auroral Ribbons]].

[[Selah]] looks at her and feels that there is something crystalline in the way [[Mira]]'s gaze watches the night sky despite her frailty. After a long breath, [[Mira]] speaks again. "Maybe that loneliness in [[Auroral Ribbons]] understands what it means to lose someone. Maybe we can teach each other, and I can finally understand peace."

[[Selah]] hugs her and softly says. "That is a love so pure it doesn't require love," and then she hums a lullaby of both grief and prayer.

[[Mira]] finally falls asleep.

It's been a week after [[Kael]]'s death. The pilgrims have prepared a building at the highest point in [[Lune Shallow]]. A secluded location overlooking the crescent shape of the moonlit bay. A place where the [[Moon]]'s light falls unobstructed by the harbor.

They bring [[Mira]] there.

She is already visibly declining. The grief of losing [[Kael]] has accelerated her own illness. Sorrow, it seems, is as lethal as any plague.

The first full moon arrives seven days after [[Kael]]'s death.

It is massive, swollen, and impossibly present. The [[Lunehymn]] flows like tears from the [[Leylines]], so abundant that it pools in the nearby veins carved by the pilgrims beneath [[Mira]]. It is silver, luminous, and beautifully reflective.

To begin the ritual of sacred communion, [[Selah]] places [[Mira]] in an ornate porcelain chair, front-facing the harbor, the waves, and the distant [[Moon]] beyond. They deliberately aim to begin on a clear night. As the reflection of the moonlight in the water creates a second [[Moon]], doubled, mirror, and infinite.

Through the preparations, [[Mira]] is conscious but distant. She is still processing [[Kael]]'s death, and her attention is scattered between her own dying body and the grief that has hollowed her from the inside. She is choosing to wear her [[Void]] [[Soul Leitmotif]]; she has created a white ribbon on her chest; in [[Consonance]], it pulsates with her own heartbeat and the melody of the lullaby she sings.

When the pilgrims bring her [[Lunehymn]] to drink, she does not refuse.

She drinks the concentrated liquid, now deep midnight blue, with stars that mirror the scene she sees, and when the vial is empty, her pain becomes distant.  She falls profoundly asleep in a dream so vivid, almost tactile, that it fills her with a presence that has been watching her for longer than she can comprehend.

In her dream, [[Mira]] finds herself in a vast darkness filled with the weight of eons.

She does not see the presence. She feels it. She understands, without words, that this thing, this [[Consciousness]] has been observing her for so long that it has forgotten there was ever a time when it was not watching her.

The presence shows her visions:

A 12-year-old girl, sitting beside a dying older woman, counting the moments between breaths, comforting her as she sings.

The same girl, now 19, holding the hand of a plague victim, whispering that his name would be remembered.

The same girl, now 22, weeping in her house after her father has died, and the [[Auroral Ribbons]] responding to her grief with their own kind of light.

And then this presence reveals their name: "[[Lacrimosa]]." echoes in the infinite darkness of this [[Void]]. Perhaps, for the first time, this presence has been present to someone else, and in this, it understands that the young girl resting there has been doing the work of the [[Moon]] while living in the world of the flesh.

"You feel like I feel," [[Lacrimosa]] continues in an impossible voice, akin to the texture of silence learning to vibrate. "You are lonely. You are grieving. You are trying to make sense of loss through presence."

[[Mira]] does not try to respond. She only acknowledges: "Yes." As she lifts her [[Void]] [[Soul Leitmotif]] from the brooch of her ribbon into the infinite presence. Letting anotherworldly, red gleam of light catch it.

The gem sparkles—as proof of her grief, proof of her loss, proof that she understands what it means to carry absence.

[[Lacrimosa]]'s form on the infinite dark trembles.

"But you do it anyway," [[Lacrimosa]] continues, "Even knowing it doesn't save anyone. You choose presence over protection."

"What else is there?" [[Mira]] asks.

And [[Lacrimosa]] does not have an answer, because it has never known. For the first time, this being has encountered something that reflects its own loneliness: not through words, but through grief itself.

[[Mira]]'s vision goes hazy, as she becomes encroached by the dark around her. 

When she opens her eyes again, she has woken up from the dream. In wonder, all the prophets stand, shocked and in awe. [[Mira]] had consumed all the [[Lunehymn]] in the veinwork of the site of the ritual.

[[Selah]] stands next to her. "Marvelous," she says proudly.

After the ritual ends, between the first and second full [[Moon]], [[Mira]] begins to truly understand what is happening.

She is not simply meeting a presence through [[Lunehymn]]-induced dreams. She is having a conversation—an actual dialogue between two [[Consciousness]]es separated by the fabric of reality itself.

On the night of the second full [[Moon]], one month after [[Kael]]'s death, [[Lacrimosa]] manifests more solidly in [[Mira]]'s dream. They are now in the fisherman's home, in the domestic, messy but meaningful state it was before his death.

[[Lacrimosa]] appears in the room, visible now, or becoming visible, as a translucent figure cloaked in violet and red, not in the [[Void]] anymore, so that [[Mira]] can now understand. [[Lacrimosa]] manifests as a woman, mirroring [[Mira]], her form still chaotic but undeniably present in moonlight.

[[Mira]], who has sat with hundreds of dying people, does not flinch. She solely observes with the clarity of someone who has learned to witness without judgment.

"You're real," [[Mira]] says, in awe yet composed.

"I don't know what I am," [[Lacrimosa]] replies, and there is something fragile in her voice—something that sounds almost terrified. "I have been watching for so long that I have forgotten what it means to be observed."

Before [[Mira]] can ask a question, [[Lacrimosa]] speaks "I want to understand something," and there is an unfamiliar texture in her voice—something that sounds almost like yearning. "I have observed countless people dying, countless moments of presence offered to those in pain. But I have never understood why you do it. Why do you offer your presence to those you cannot save?"

[[Mira]] looks at her with eyes that are beginning to understand what they are perceiving.

"Because if I don't," [[Mira]] says, "they disappear completely. Their ending becomes invisible. But if I'm there, if I see it happen, then the ending is not one of solitude anymore. And that means they mattered, if only to me. That means they continue to exist if I keep their memory and legacy, for much longer than their death."

[[Lacrimosa]]'s form wavers, ringing through states that oscillate with something like emotion.

"That's not logical," [[Lacrimosa]] says, trying to make sense of her words. "That doesn't change anything about the outcome. They still die. They still disappear."

"Yes," [[Mira]] agrees, not defensively but with a naive clarity [[Lacrimosa]] instantly recognizes. "But the fact that they are seen while it happens, transforms it. It gives it a meaning that creates a transition where there would be erasure. It makes it so that they were released by someone who cared, if only briefly."

There is a long silence.

Then [[Lacrimosa]] speaks, and her voice trembles:

"What if I told you that I have been watching you? That every time you sit with someone while they die, I feel their [[Resonance]] through the [[Auroral Ribbons]]? What if I told you that I exist in a state of eternal watching, and I am so desperately lonely that I have begun to believe I was never meant to be seen?"

[[Mira]]'s grip tightens on the [[Void]] gem of her ribbon.

"Then I would tell you that you're being seen right now," Mira says. "Not by someone important or powerful. But by someone who understands the loneliness of abandonment intimately. By someone who just lost the person who truly saw them grow their whole life, and is now learning to see others in their place."

She pauses, gathering courage.

"I would tell you that maybe you should do what I do. Maybe you should offer your presence to those who are in pain. Maybe you should stop watching alone and start witnessing with them. With you, together."

[[Lacrimosa]]'s form goes very still.

"You're asking me to—"

"I'm asking you," [[Mira]] interrupts gently, "to become what I've been trying to be for these past years. To be the witness that can care for those pained souls. To offer presence not as their salvation but as proof that they once mattered. That they will continue to exist as I remember them with me."

[[Lacrimosa]] recoils, her form fragmenting further and desperately fighting not to retreat to the comforting coldness of the [[Void]].

"I can't do that. You're asking me to step into the world in your place. To become visible through you. To be vulnerable in a way I—" She stops herself. "I don't understand how to do what you do."

"Neither did I," [[Mira]] says quietly. "Maybe it is because of the loneliness that abandonment taught me, or I learned by doing it. And you've been watching me do it for two years. You understand more than you believe."

But [[Lacrimosa]] shakes her head, and her voice becomes almost desperate:

"If I do this—if I become you, if what you're asking—then I would have to remain. To stay present. To feel loss when people die. I can't... I can't bear to feel. And you would—"

[[Mira]] looks at her with absolute compassion and understanding.

"Yes, you can," [[Mira]] says. "Because you're already feeling. You've been feeling for a very long time. The difference is that right now, you're feeling alone. What I'm asking is that you feel with others. That you bear witness in care together instead of watching—."

"But don't you wish you could prevent it entirely?" [[Lacrimosa]], in a cold response, stops her before she can finish the sentence. "If you had power—cosmic power—would you use it to prevent their suffering?"

The sudden question puzzles [[Mira]], but she tries to make up for her words. "I... I've never had the choice. I've only known powerlessness. But I think... if I could prevent suffering by choosing to love... to choose connection... maybe that would be the greater compassion."

The [[Moon]] is full above them, impossibly present, seeping moonlight through the cracks of the ceiling.

"I don't know what the best outcome is, but if you think about it," [[Mira]] says, not as pressure, but as gentleness. "We could understand the absence is the [[Void]] suffering leaves. I still have time."  

[[Mira]] reaches out and takes what appears to be [[Lacrimosa]]'s hand—the ghost of a hand, the approximation of touch that an [[Outer God]] and a dying girl can manage. Her lungs were burning with effort, her body already beginning the severe decline into the final weeks of her illness.

"Let me observe you," [[Mira]] says. "Let me witness you, the way I've witnessed everyone else. Let me be the last consciousness that sees you, before I..."

She does not finish. She does not need to.

[[Lacrimosa]] takes her hand—and for the first time in her entire existence, the [[Outer God]] truly comprehends what it means to touch someone.

The contact sends shocks through both of them.

For [[Lacrimosa]], it is the first genuine connection in eons of isolation.

For [[Mira]], it is confirmation that what she is experiencing is not madness, but something as fundamental as death, as grief, as loss.

When she wakes up again, she doesn't feel the haziness she felt the first time, but warmth, albeit hollow.

[[Mira]] begins singing to the moon-swept sea below, the melody of her [[Soul Leitmotif]] as her lullaby, as the omen to the melody of the [[Moon]].

While the ritual ends, over the course of the three full [[Moon]]s that mark [[Mira]]'s final months of life, they speak.

Not constantly. [[Mira]] does not have the energy for that. But on the nights when the [[Moon]] is full, when the [[Lunehymn]] flows strongest, they meet in the sanctuary and talk.

Two months after [[Kael]]'s death, [[Lacrimosa]] begins to understand what presence and passing meant.

[[Mira]] tells her about every person she has ever sat with while they died.

"There was a child," she says, her voice barely a whisper, "maybe seven years old. He had a fever that wouldn't break. He asked me if it would hurt when he died. And instead of lying, instead of saying 'No, you'll be fine,' I told him the truth: dying might hurt, but being seen while you're dying makes it hurt less. That someone caring about you makes it hurt less."

"Did he believe you?" [[Lacrimosa]] asks.

"I don't know," [[Mira]] admits. "But he held my hand. And when the moment came, he was holding it still, even if the light was already gone. I think that's a sort of belief. Of love, perhaps."

"But there's something I've never told anyone, [[Lacrimosa]]. Something I've been thinking about as I've sat with all these dying people." [[Mira]] replies with a slight hint of guilt in her voice. "Every single person I've comforted and sat with at their end has always said the same thing without words. They repeatedly say with regret: 'I wish I hadn't suffered. I wish I'd had peace.' And I hold their hand, and I saw, 'It's okay. I see you. You mattered, and that's enough."

[[Mira]] carefully thinks of her following words. "I believe this is a beautiful way to comfort their despair, but... I'm not really thinking that, I just wish I could have given them peace before the pain found anyone." 

[[Mira]] then sighs with relief.

"Have you thought about it?" [[Mira]] asks, her voice brittle now, each word deliberate and counted.

[[Lacrimosa]] looks at her, and there is something wounded in her gaze.

"Every moment since you asked, but are you aware of what it will cost you? What you're asking me to do is take on your body. And you will cease to be you." [[Lacrimosa]] admits.

[[Mira]] is first contemplative in silence, but then she reassures her. "I know, I will die regardless, and I've known since three years, and I've been trying to make peace with it since I began witnessing the passing of others, but this fear is not something that witnessing washes away." She suddenly stops to gather courage. "I— want to transcend at least... if I have the chance to make my death mean something."

"When they came to me— when [[Selah]] and the pilgrims came to me." [[Mira]] talks in almost a murmur, "I told them I wouldn't speak to you for saving, or for healing, I instead want to seal the loop of the abandonment that has defined my life. I want some agency, so that at least everyone I've lost will continue, in the memory of whatever I become... in your memory."

The tension can be felt by both. [[Mira]] realizes [[Lacrimosa]] 's panic and that she's about to retreat into isolation again, but she suddenly stops her.

"Tell me what it is that frightens you most, please!" [[Mira]] says in a resonant, powerful voice for the first time.

[[Lacrimosa]], startled, is silent for a long time before speaking.

"Erasure— And the piercing clarity to realize all that would cease wrong. That if I step into the world as you're asking, I will no longer be separate. I will no longer have the clarity of observation. And I'm afraid that I will have to accept that my presence doesn't save them, and I don't even know if I could live on through you. I have spent eons believing that if I could understand enough, if I could just be clear enough, then maybe I could matter."

She pauses, and when she continues, her voice is barely audible:

"But you're telling me that understanding perfectly doesn't matter. What matters is showing up and being willing to receive the suffering when others hurt, when you hurt. And I don't know how to do that."

[[Mira]]'s thumb traces the back of [[Lacrimosa]]'s hand—or tries to, though her touch passes through something formless.

"I wasn't always orphaned," [[Mira]] begins, and [[Lacrimosa]] understands: this is the confession she has been waiting for. "My biological father was dying, and he brought me to a safer place. He left me at a dock because he loved me enough to give me a chance at life that he couldn't give me himself. Even if he wasn't here."

She looks at [[Lacrimosa]] with eyes pained in sorrow, ancient but young at once.

"I have mixed feelings about that. I resented the families I saw alongside the dying. I grew up understanding that safety was conditional. That love could end. And I thought that understanding that—being clear about it, being certain of it—would make it hurt less. But it didn't."

[[Mira]] softly sobs. "It just made me terrified of losing the next person I loved. It made me terrified of my own, meaningless, death. I fear erasure as much as you do."

Her breathing becomes shallower as tears form in her eyes, but she doesn't stop.

"Then [[Kael]] died. And I realized something: all my understanding, all my clarity, didn't change anything. He was still gone. I was still alone. The only difference is that I chose to sit with the dying instead of running from them. I don't know if it was a good choice, but if it led me to you. Then, it— it must mean something!"

She squeezes [[Lacrimosa]]'s hand, though the touch is almost entirely in [[Lacrimosa]]'s imagination now.

"You've been clear about everything for a very long time," [[Mira]] says. "But clarity doesn't solve loneliness. Only carrying their memory does, and that is a sort of witnessing. Only choosing to be with someone, even when it hurts, even when you can't fix it, even when it ends in loss. If they continue to live through you, then they are not truly gone."

"If they could live... through me." [[Mira]] replies in a hollowed voice, muted by an emotion that can't make the words anymore.

"They live inside you," [[Lacrimosa]] says slowly, and her form wavers slightly as she tries to grasp the concept. "Your [[Consciousness]] carries them after they die." 

"Yes," [[Mira]] says. "And that's how they continue. That's how they matter. Because I chose to see them, and now I'm changed by them forever..."

[[Lacrimosa]]'s form becomes almost translucent, beginning to fracture with emotion that mirrors the tears running through the cheeks of the soft, ill-touched edges of [[Mira]]'s face.

"I think I understand," she says, but her voice is uncertain. "Inside. They become part of you. Inside your... everything. Your thoughts. Your memories. Your love." 

"Yes," [[Mira]] says gently. "Is that so terrible?"

"No," [[Lacrimosa]] whispers. "It sounds like... like finally having a place. Like finally being inside something instead of outside looking in."

[[Mira]] reaches for her hand. "That's presence," She says. "That's what I've been trying to teach you." 

[[Lacrimosa]] closes her hollowed eyes. But she is not thinking about [[Mira]]'s lesson. She is thinking about something else. Something that sounds similar but is rooted in something different.

Her form trembles, and after a pause, she speaks.

"I too, grieve," [[Lacrimosa]] says suddenly, and it is a confession that seems to shock her even as she speaks it. "I have been grieving for so long that I forgot it was grief. I thought it was just a weight I was carrying in observation. But it's grief. I grieve for the identity I could never reach, and the fantasy that died alongside it when I finally dared to do something."

[[Mira]]'s eyes widen slightly.

"Then you understand," [[Mira]] says gently. "You understand what it means to lose someone without ever having had them. To miss someone who was never yours to have."

[[Lacrimosa]] nods, unable to speak.

"That's why you should witness for those pained souls," [[Mira]] continues. "Because you understand that kind of grief. You understand wanting to reach toward someone and not being able to. You can teach others that their grief—their missing, their longing, their impossible love—is real, valid, and important. And in stopping their suffering..."

She pauses, gathering strength for what she needs to say next.

"If you do that, then losing [[Kael]]... it won't be invisible. He and I will be part of what you carry forward. And you could give a relief from meaning. You would help ease what we have all suffered because you, too, know the depth of not having anyone."

[[Lacrimosa]] begins to weep, as if learning to feel, still taken by the words [[Mira]] earlier said about having something become a part of you—the clarity in her mind a prison for her thoughts of what could go wrong.

"I'm afraid," [[Lacrimosa]] admits.

"I know," [[Mira]] whispers. "So am I. But we can be afraid together. That's what witnessing the last moments means."

After a silence, [[Mira]] stands pointing to the skies. "Maybe that is the [[Purest of Love]]. A love so pure it maybe doesn't require love," she briefly pauses. "Not because it isn't genuine, but because of what my father did was one directional. Some love doesn't really require recognition, so long as you carry it with you. And in carrying that burden, you release them from the meaning of their suffering." 

"Maybe... it could be, too, something, almost like intimacy... what you can do for me, when I finally rest." [[Mira]] says softly, in pained words, barely able to speak through her plea. "I don't want to die, but it's inevitable. I have suffered too much from loss and abandonment. Maybe if a world existed where we could all be together, even if in memory, it would be one of love. And you could be its architect, please."

"I could be— finally? An... an architect of something?" [[Lacrimosa]] replies in the fractured voice of a lost fantasy.

"Yes, through embodying me, you could finally stop the meaningless suffering I've had to watch one too many times from witnessing death. You can make it meaningful, and that, in itself, makes you the core of a family—Or at least the fantasy I have of one." [[Mira]] now in softer words: "I never had one, and I deeply fear the abandonment of dying alone. That's why— I want for you to accept me and make my death meaningful."

And now, looking at the [[Moon]], [[Mira]] hums that sweet melody that reminds her of a gentler past.

[[Lacrimosa]], in silence, retreats. She is still processing what [[Mira]] just said. And the thought of action drives her impossibly mad to everything that could fail.

The dream suddenly ends, but [[Lacrimosa]] learns that presence is not about saving anyone. It is about bearing witness to the fact that they existed, and that their suffering isn't only meaningful but rather the freedom that the release of suffering gives.

She learns that love—real love—is not about being essential in an infinite sense. It is about choosing to matter infinitely to one person, in one moment. And from that moment, to carry their memory, their suffering with you, is the same as if they're still living.  

She learns that the girl she has been speaking to—this ordinary, orphaned, dying girl—understands something that she, herself, has spent eons trying to grasp in [[The Infinite Void]]: that invisibility is only unbearable if you stop trying to reach toward others. That loneliness only becomes absolute if you stop being present to it. It is the merger of two [[Consciousness]], which makes their suffering into [[Consonance]].

Six months after [[Kael]]'s death. The final full [[Moon]] rises, the last one [[Mira]] will see.

She is skeletal now, nearly as translucent as [[Lacrimosa]]. Her breathing is a conscious effort. Her voice has become something thin and reedy, like a wind instrument at the edge of breaking.

"Have you decided?" [[Mira]] asks.

[[Lacrimosa]] sits beside her. For the first time, the [[Outer God]] appears almost entirely solid—nearly human—as if her repeated presence in this space, her repeated exposure to [[Mira]]'s love, has been slowly teaching her how to be real.

They are no longer in the fisherman's home. They are in the same sacred space, where the ritual is being held, with the entire view of the crescent shape of [[Lune Shallow]]'s bay.

"I can't," [[Lacrimosa]] says, but her voice wavers. "I'm not ready. I don't know if I can bear the weight of what you're asking. I don't know if I can learn to be present when everything I have ever done is to observe from a distance." 

[[Lacrimosa]] then speaks in a clarity of her newfound empathy for [[Mira]]. "I still don't think you understand what it means for me to take you as a vessel. And I can't afford to bear the consequences if I were to hurt you."

[[Mira]] reaches out with her remaining strength and takes [[Lacrimosa]]'s gentle hand. This time, the touch is real. This time, [[Lacrimosa]] is solid enough to feel it.

"Then don't decide now," [[Mira]] says in soft sobs. "Just stay with me, please. Just be present while I'm here. That's all I'm asking. Just witness me leaving, the way I've cared for everyone else. I don't want to be abandoned again."

[[Lacrimosa]] grips [[Mira]]'s hand—or tries to, though her form is beginning to waver as the night deepens.

"I don't understand death," [[Lacrimosa]] says, and it is a confession born from genuine fear. "I have observed it countless times, but I don't understand it. I don't understand how someone stops being."

"It hurts, but life and every end in itself does, because that's the [[Weight of Change]]." [[Mira]] confirms. "But only the ending of their life is final. They don't become erased; it is everyone's presence that continues. Everyone I've ever sat with while they died, they're still here in me. In my hands, in the way I move and speak. They're in the presence I offer to their relief. That's how they continue."

She pauses.

"And if you witness for them after I'm gone—if you reach out to those who are grieving, those who are in pain—then I too will continue through your presence, even if I'm not here. Everyone I ever loved will continue through the work you do."

[[Lacrimosa]]'s form fractures further, beginning to become almost transparent with emotion. Unable to maintain a solid link.

"I don't know how to let you go," [[Lacrimosa]] says.

"You don't have to," [[Mira]] whispers with tears in her eyes. "If you embody me, we will be together forever. And in that love, in which you only have to see me leave, you will carry my memory."

"Please, be the witness that teaches how to reach others, to relieve them of their suffering." [[Mira]] pleads, now crying. "Be, for me, the [[Purest of Love]], that [[Humanity]] could receive. One that will never abandon anyone anymore. And maybe, we could all finally be what I've always wanted— A single, beautiful family."

The dual [[Moon]] is full, as above them as it is below in the windswept ocean across the cliff. The [[Lunehymn]] river flows thickly through the [[Leylines]], almost as if responding to the intensity of this moment. A clear, beautiful sky, reflecting the landscape of the lullaby [[Mira]] always sang.

As the night deepens, [[Mira]]'s breathing becomes fainter.

Then fainter.

Then it becomes something else, barely clinging.

[[Lacrimosa]] sits beside her, holding her hand, embracing her, and she experiences something she has never experienced in her entire existence: she is present for something ending, and she is choosing not to retreat.

She is choosing to bear witness.

[[Mira]]'s eyes, which have been dimming for hours, suddenly focus one last time.

She looks directly at [[Lacrimosa]]—and in that look is everything: gratitude, grief, recognition, love in its most essential form.

"I can see it," Mira whispers. "The light. Not in the sky, but in you. Your [[Auroral Ribbons]] are beautiful. I feel scared, but they are comforting. The light, it's like... like loss, but freedom too... It's like being released from the burden that I've been carrying my whole life. I don't feel abandoned anymore. Thanks to you, [[Lacrimosa]]."

Her [[Void]] [[Soul Leitmotif]] now flickers, not just with her heartbeat, but as if the glow itself is dimming out. The soft purple receding to black.

In one last effort, [[Mira]] points to her ribbon, to her brooch, to her heart. 

"Don't go," [[Lacrimosa]] says, and it is the first true prayer she has ever spoken, "I'm not ready to be invisible again."

[[Mira]]'s gentle smile becomes beatific, even as her eyes begin to glaze.

"You are here," she whispers. "You've been learning your whole existence. You just have to choose to act."

And then there is the moment—that precise, countable moment that [[Mira]] has witnessed hundreds of times—where the light leaves the eyes.

Where [[Mira]]'s hand finally goes still.

Where one [[Consciousness]] dissolves, and another learns what it means to remain.

In the moment after, [[Lacrimosa]] does not cry out.

She does not shatter.

Instead, she does what [[Mira]] has been practicing for three months: she witnesses, and carries her in her arms while caressing that once lively cheek, in honor of her passing.

She sees the body that was [[Mira]]—now empty, now a vessel that held [[Consciousness]] like a cup held water.

She sees the space in the room where [[Mira]]'s presence was, now filled with the absence of presence.

She holds the [[Void]] gem that [[Mira]] pointed in her heart—that teardrop of crystallized grief, proof that [[Mira]] existed and loved, as it begins to dissolve.

And then [[Lacrimosa]] feels something she has never felt before.

She recognizes the lullaby's melody as it enters her [[Auroral Ribbons]]. It is [[Mira]].

It deeply moves [[Lacrimosa]]. She is witnessing that [[Mira]]'s [[Consciousness]] is not disappearing but transforming.

As [[Mira]]'s body ceases, as her [[Consciousness]] departs into [[The First Overtone]], it does not scatter into nothing. Instead, it flows—like water finding its path—a [[Flux]] along the [[Auroral Ribbons]], but it's not the same feeling from all of the other souls that have passed since they were woven through the original tears of [[Lacrimosa]].

And for the first time, [[Lacrimosa]] realizes what the [[Auroral Ribbons]] truly are: they never were threads of sorrow. They are conduits of presence.

And [[Mira]]'s distilled [[Consciousness]]—concentrated, crystallized, luminous with the weight of everything she has ever lived, everything she loved—is now traveling through her presence. [[Lacrimosa]] feels not just what [[Mira]] had lost, but feels the warmth of her understanding, a profound moment of intimacy in their bond that can stand even beyond death.

"Wait," [[Lacrimosa]] desperately to the [[Void]], to the presence she can feel but no longer see. "Don't go far. I'm not ready to be invisible again."

And the presence stills. It hesitates. It does not depart further into the afterlife.

Instead, it hovers on the rim of the filaments in the [[Auroral Ribbons]] that surround [[Lacrimosa]]'s real form and [[The Infinite Void]], as if waiting. And, for the first time in her entire existence, [[Lacrimosa]] grieves. Not the abstract, observational grief she has carried for eons. But real grief. The grief of losing someone she truly loved. 

The grief of watching a [[Consciousness]] that mattered to her step beyond the edge of existence, beyond the edge of her.

She weeps for [[Mira]], for [[Kael]], for the father [[Mira]] never knew, for everyone that [[Mira]] ever sat with while they died.

She weeps for all the loneliness she has carried, all the moments she watched and did not manifest, all the presence she offered from a distance when what was needed was closeness.

She weeps until her vast, impossible form invites the [[Auroral Ribbons]] to coil around her, as they begin to shimmer and sing.

They are singing with [[Mira]]'s presence. They are singing on a chorus of the lullaby with the [[Consciousness]] of a dying girl who chose to witness, who decided to love, who chose to reach back across the [[Void]] toward the thing that was so desperately lonely.

As dawn breaks over [[Lune Shallow]], and the [[Moon]] finally dives under the sea. [[Lacrimosa]] finally makes a choice. 

"I understand," [[Lacrimosa]] says to the emptiness.

For the first time, she makes the one, single irrational decision she had always feared. [[Lacrimosa]] knew of all that could go wrong, but in that vulnerable moment, with the [[Auroral Ribbons]] still entangled to her, and in a hymn to the presence of [[Mira]] she can feel but not see.

[[Lacrimosa]] finally decides to act.

The piercing clarity of her instinct was still desperately ringing with all that could fail, but she decided to ignore it, for the first time in the eons since her existence.

She opened herself, her impossibly large [[Consciousness]], with the option to merge.

[[Lacrimosa]] knew she would inevitably fail, but to honor that one thing [[Mira]] had been constantly requesting from her all those full [[Moon]]s ago, it didn't matter. For she had realized that she was not choosing something for herself but for someone so precious that did not deserve to be abandoned anymore.

And [[Mira]]'s essence—not her body, but her pure [[Consciousness]], everything that made her present, everything that made her able to witness—flows into [[Lacrimosa]].

From the union of this impossible large merge, the [[Auroral Ribbons]] create a flash in the sky visible from every corner of [[Arcanoria]]. In poetic irony, [[Lacrimosa]] stopped being invisible in a way that was visible for every single living thing in [[Arcanoria]] to see. It was the time when the world witnessed her becoming truly real, in a display of beautiful auroral lights in the dawning sky.

[[Mira]] came to teach [[Lacrimosa]] a new architecture of how an [[Outer God]] came to understand the simple humanity of a dying girl, understanding of love, of ending, of suffering, and of a memory immortal resting at the shoulders of [[Lacrimosa]].

And, for the first time in [[Arcanoria]] history, a mortal had made an [[Outer God]] gain an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]].

[[Lacrimosa]] descends from the skies. She allows, finally, her [[Consciousness]] to fully manifest.

And when [[Lacrimosa]] rises from [[Mira]]'s body, who was placed in the center of the sanctuary, beneath the enormous windows that face where the moon should be, she is still [[Lacrimosa]]. But she is irrevocably changed.

She had incarnated, with [[Mira]]'s once hollow body as a host. Filling the space where once was [[Mira]]'s [[Soul-Key]] with her own. The vessel was frail and delicate, akin to a puppet if nothing more, but her body was healed and [[Mira]]'s lullaby now lived in her own [[Soul Leitmotif]] gem.

It was still a thin tether, yet the only actual linking of [[Lacrimosa]] to [[Arcanoria]]. 

And thus, the pilgrims had achieved the impossible: making the divine descend.

They created a way of bypassing the limit of [[Sufficient Precision]] that prevented [[Outer God]]s from reaching the threshold of mortality and directly affecting the realm.

[[Lacrimosa]] standing in the newfound body was declared the first miracle by the pilgrims of the [[Purest of Love]]. [[Selah]], overjoyed, couldn't contain her emotion. And, in song, they all celebrate for it is the first time the divine came to [[Arcanoria]], after ages bygone of meaningless suffering gone in unanswered prayers.

[[Selah]] still knew that they needed a definite body for [[Lacrimosa]] to inhabit. But for now, this was enough.

[[Mira]] had been enough.

She had transcended to become the chosen of the [[Moon]]. Of [[Lacrimosa]]'s [[Moon]].

[[Lacrimosa]] places her hand on what used to be [[Mira]]'s heart—but now hers is hollow, still, but with the lingering warmth of a presence that shaped her in such little time. She feels the sensation of the wind for the first time, and in it, the fragility of life.

[[Lacrimosa]]'s speaking from the first time from [[Mira]]'s voice says to the skies. "You were left at a dock when you were three years old. You grew up understanding that safety was conditional, abandoned. And instead of letting that wound make you cruel, you taught me intimacy, and to relieve the burden of suffering through my own."

[[Lacrimosa]]'s new voice, testing the limits of her mortality, shouted from the windswept cliff in a promise. "I will become what you were supposed to become forever. I will be the presence you wanted to offer that will never abandon anyone. I will fill the space left behind, even through my own hollowness."

She looks up at where the moon should be, but finds only darkness. "And I will never, ever let anyone suffer alone again."

[[Lacrimosa]] then decided to honor the beautiful last sight that [[Mira]] had of the [[Auroral Ribbons]] during her passing moments. She wanted to immortalize in a way the last genuine sight of wonder she had before [[Lacrimosa]] had taken her eyes.

She wanted to honor her memory, their bond, and in it. At least to have her release of suffering as the true, final moment they held together. And so she put a blindfold to protect that memory, one single ornate string that she would permanently wear, for [[Mira]]'s eyes would not see cruelty nor the suffering of abandonment ever again.

[[Lacrimosa]], feeling deep at her own mortality, said in oath and as her last act of intimacy with [[Mira]], what she had told her in her deathbed:

"For your memory, your love, your thoughts, everything, lies now in me. I will carry the burden, with your [[Consciousness]] as the anchor, to what will become a new world. One born as a single, beautiful family, from the [[Purest of Love]]."
