#spellweaving

The moment you receive a [[Soul Leitmotif]], the moment after hitting "rock-bottom" it is a deep personal moment of realization that awakens the magic of any [[Spellweaver]]. All magic starts unstable because these are awakened at the lowest but the [[Spellweaver]] must equally find the strength to weave both magic and resolve their personal conflicts.
