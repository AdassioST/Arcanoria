[[In-Depth Legend and Stellar Legacy Score]]

Everything in [[The Eternal Symphony]] given an audible score that binds all [[Legend]]s from all [[Ages]] as a powerful living mythos that modifies the structure of the world. A celestial ledger that transforms individual stories into world-altering myths. Each [[Legend]] does not merely live and die; they compose a personal symphony of actions and choices that, upon their death, are canonized into a [[Constellation]] — a permanent note in the grand score of [[The Eternal Symphony]].

In this system, a [[Legend]] is an exceptional individual whose life story generates [[Resonance]]. The [[Stellar Legacy Score]] is the culmination of the resolution of [[Events]], and [[Ballad]]s, where the roles of [[Major Actor]] and [[Minor Actor]] are embodied during [[World Event]]s and [[Age Crisis]]es in the [[Fate Stage]]. It is in these crucibles of history that [[Legend]]s forge their [[Lyrical Fragment]]s into [[Legend Opus]] and [[Legend Title]]s. Thus, [[Legend]]s do not just level up; they compose their personal mythos through gameplay and create their traits based on it.

When an age ends, or when the [[Legend]] dies, their story is "canonized" into [[The Eternal Symphony]], allowing future generations to channel them as [[Constellation]]-like figures across the bars of the [[Stellar Legacy Score]]. Each an [[Act of Fate]] with their whole life story. (e.g., "The King Who Knelt" or "The Butcher of the Silent Expanse"). The process of creating a [[Constellation]] is a sacred art, requiring the harmonious interplay of [[Lyrical Fragment]]s, roles in the [[Fate Stage]], and [[Legend Title]] canonization in their [[Legend Opus]].

Thus, the [[Stellar Legacy Score]] is the final, eternal expression of a [[Legend]]'s journey, and the foundation upon which future [[Ages]] build their myths.

This creates a lineage of myth that directly impacts gameplay mechanics (economy, warfare, magic) based on who these people were and what story they built. In life they are the [[Major Actor]]s of [[Civilization]], and the members of its founding and governing council. After death, the [[Stellar Legacy Score]] ensures that the foundation of [[Civilization]] is remembered as [[Constellation]]s guiding future [[Ages]] and new [[Legend]]s.

### The Core of [[Arcanoria]]'s Legacy

The [[Stellar Legacy Score]] transforms "[[Legend]]s" from static units into evolving narrative engines. It unifies the mechanical depth of lifestyle progression, the utility of [[Great Spellweaver]]s, and the metaphysical lore of [[Arcanoria]] into a cohesive loop where [[Civilization]] do not just play characters — they author their gods.

The core loop is cyclical:

1. **The Origin (Rags):** A mortal "Underdog" rises from a [[Motif Awakening]], and have to make sense of their wound as they develop their [[Spellweaving]].
2. **The Journey ([[Legend]]):** Actions generate [[Lyrical Fragment]]s that eventually crystallize through [[Events]] into [[Legend Title]]s and [[Legend Opus]]s.
3. **The Legacy ([[Constellation]]):** Upon death, the [[Legend]] ascends to [[The Eternal Symphony]], where their [[Consciousness]] is the ink that determines each [[Act of Fate]], becoming a world-altering [[Constellation]] in the [[Stellar Legacy Score]].
4. **The Synthesis ([[Syncretism]]):** Future [[Legend]]s "Channel" these Constellations, warping their ancient myths through new contexts to create "Syncretic" powers.

Furthermore, [[Legend]]s that are of great renown become the leaders of [[Civilization]], and each of these have a class based on their [[Soul Leitmotif]] and their contribution as [[Great Spellweaver]]s which share an affinity within [[The Principles of Magic]] and a specific function of [[Civilization]]:

- [[Great Sovereign]] ([[Resonance]] Affinity): Unity, Identity, Diplomacy, Purpose.
- [[Great Seer]] ([[Luminance]] Affinity): Truth, Science, [[Faith]], World-view.
- [[Great Concertist]] ([[Flux]] Affinity): Culture, Emotion, Arts, Social Engineering.
- [[Great Justiciar]] ([[Void]] Affinity): Sacrifice, Law, Justice, Morality.
- [[Great Vanguard]] ([[Cindergale]] Affinity): War, Momentum, Conflict, Defense. 
- [[Great Architect]] ([[Crystal]] Affinity): Economy, Infrastructure, Ambition, Growth.
- [[Great Chronicler]] ([[Strand]] Affinity): History, Wealth, Reliquaries, Vaults.

While [[Great Spellweaver]]s are usually of their element affinity, they aren't locked to it. Instead, [[Great Spellweaver]]s are made through their actions. A [[Resonance]] [[Spellweaver]] can be a [[Great Vanguard]] just as much as a [[Luminance]] [[Spellweaver]] can be a [[Great Justiciar]]. It all depends on their [[Legend Opus]] and [[Lyrical Fragment]]s.

### The Narrative Engine of [[The Eternal Symphony]]

_"A life is not measured in years, but in the [[Ballad]]s that are sung after. A [[Legend]] is written through their deeds and legacy, never predetermined to fate."_

Every significant action a [[Legend]] takes generates [[Lyrical Fragment]]s, each a symbol of a facet of courage in [[Consciousness]] and are contrary to the [[Seven Weights]]. In this sense, XP is replaced by these [[Lyrical Fragment]]s as they are the building blocks of a [[Legend]]'s personal mythos and the resolution of their story.

Collecting enough of a type allows creating a [[Legend Opus]] which are traits containing [[Legend Title]]s. The fragments are the following:

- [[Fragment of Meaning]] ([[Resonance]]): Earned through acts of self-discovery, purpose and unity.
- [[Fragment of Lucidity]] ([[Luminance]]): Earned through pursuit of truth and clarity.
- [[Fragment of Catharsis]] ([[Flux]]): Earned through high states of emotional release.
- [[Fragment of Acceptance]] ([[Void]]): Earned through sacrifice and letting go.
- [[Fragment of Defiance]] ([[Cindergale]]): Earned through resistance and overcoming.
- [[Fragment of Vision]] ([[Crystal]]): Earned through will, determination, and creation.
- [[Fragment of Renewal]] ([[Strand]]): Earned through transformation.

Every significant action during [[Events]] generates a [[Lyrical Fragment]] tagged with their respective Binding/Emotion.

- _Example:_ Winning a battle against overwhelming odds -> Generates a [[Fragment of Defiance]] ([[Cindergale]]).

When a [[Legend]] collects enough [[Lyrical Fragment]]s they can forge a [[Legend Opus]] from their unlocked [[Legend Title]]s, creating a permanent trait that encapsulates a chapter of their life. A [[Legend]] may hold several [[Lesser Opus]]s but only one [[Magnum Opus]], the latter being their defining myth and overarching life story. It is, essentially, their life's greatest work.

- _Example of [[Legend Opus]]:_ The King Who Knelt
    - _Unlock:_ Surrendered to an enemy to save the populace from eternal damnation (Diplomacy/Sacrifice).
    - _Effect:_ Loyalty +120, Vassal Opinion +50 (They love you for saving them), Prestige -100 (External realms mock you). Unique interaction: "Peaceful Annexation" becomes easier.
    
- _Example [[Legend Opus]]:_ Impaler of [[The Silent Expanse]]
    - _Unlock:_ Executed many prisoners and became one of the most feared warriors during the [[Age of Blood]] (Martial/Void).
    - _Effect:_ Dread +100, Enemy Morale -50%. Unique interaction: Can "Consume" enemy prisoners to restore own Army Supply.

**The "Underdog" Modifier:** Some [[Legend]]s have disadvantageous traits usually paired with low origins (Orphan, Exile) despite being harder to grow, these [[Legend]]s generate 2x Fragments when punching up, mechanically incentivizing "Rags to Riches" play whenever they perform an action "above their station."

- A peasant winning a duel against a knight.
- A forsaken bastard finally becoming a baron.
- A former debtor amassing wealth.

This ensures that the "Rags-to-Riches" arc is mechanically superior, albeit much harder in execution for generating [[Legend Opus]], making the humble origin the high-risk high-reward choice for players who want powerful [[Constellation]]s at the cost of higher probability of failure.

Another type of unique [[Legend Opus]] are [[Slayer Magnum Opus]]. These are unique, permanent [[Legend Title]]s earned by doing a legendary achievement for the first time such as defeating any high ranking [[Atonalis]], like a [[Primal Discordia]] or sealing an impossibly vast [[Primal White Noise]] rift. Thus, the first [[Legend]] to ever kill a specific [[Primal Discordia]] or [[Dissonance]] [[Landmark]] earns a [[Slayer Magnum Opus]]. This is a unique, unrepeatable modifier.

- **Example:** The first player to kill "The Discord Weaver" across their playthrough earns "First to Silence the Weeping World". This [[Slayer Magnum Opus]] is permanently unique to that [[Legend]]'s [[Constellation]].
- **Consequence:** Future [[Legend]]s can kill the same [[Atonalis]], as it will respawn in later [[Ages]], but they will only get the standard The Sorrow-Eater [[Legend Opus]]. The "First" [[Slayer Magnum Opus]] variant is gone forever, held by the original [[Constellation]].

This creates permanent narrative scarcity. [[Civilization]] is incentivized to hunt a powerful [[Atonalis]] early, knowing the first kill is the most valuable.

| [[Atonalis]] Path | [[Primal Discordia]]   | [[Legend Opus]]  | Mechanical Bonus                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Anxithor]]      | The Shrieking Sentinel | The Unafraid      | Legend and their armies are immune to "Fear" status.           |
| [[Discant]]       | The Discord Weaver     | The Sorrow-Eater  | Can convert realm "Unrest" into "[[Piety]]" resource.          |
| [[Obsessian]]     | The Looped Revenant    | Breaker of Cycles | Immune to "Curse" debuffs; can break enemy siege loops.        |
| [[Signath]]       | The Hollow Pilgrim     | The Certain       | Immune to enemy "Schemes" and info-hazards.                    |
| [[Carnalix]]      | The Corpus Mortuum     | The Scar-Hewn     | [[Legend]] cannot die from wounds; only from age or sacrifice. |
| [[Animach]]       | The Morpheus Abysmal   | The Whole         | [[Legend]] cannot be "charmed" or have loyalty manipulated.    |
| [[Violux]]        | The Imperium Obsessus  | The Unbroken      | [[Legend]]'s armies never rout; fight to the last.             |
| [[Erosyx]]        | The Wrongly Named      | The True-Named    | [[Legend]]'s "Status" cannot be falsified or stolen.           |

Finally, the last piece of the puzzle for [[Legend Opus]] and [[Magnum Opus]] is the [[Fate Stage]], where [[Legend]]s embody the roles of [[Major Actor]]s, [[Minor Actor]]s. The world is a theatrical composition, and [[Legend]]s grow into their roles through the choices they make during [[Ballad]]s, [[World Event]]s and [[Age Crisis]]es.

The [[Fate Stage]] is the dynamic theater where [[Legend]]s attain their [[Legend Title]]s by reaching the conclusion of [[Events]] [[Ballad]]s by embodying roles that are not chosen but attracted through their actions. Each role has a narrative signature, and by accumulating [[Story Affinity]] through aligned decisions, a [[Legend]] becomes the living embodiment of that role.

The [[Fate Stage]] is the proving ground and growth for [[Legend]]s. Some of these may be considered [[World Event]]s which are vast [[Ballad]]s affecting the fate of many characters. They're most prominent during an [[Age Crisis]] where the actions of [[Legend]]s during critical events determine the [[World Truth]]s that will shape the next coming [[Ages]] regardless of its outcome as a [[Golden Age]], [[Dark Age]] or [[Standard Age]].

Some [[World Event]]s are vast enough and present opposing forces as factions with their own dedicated agenda. These [[World Event]]s utilize the full potential of the [[Fate Stage]] to not just determine [[Ballad]]s but to encompass an overarching theme during a given age. The first time more roles are introduced is during [[Ages]] III with [[The Hollowing]] of [[Lacrimosa]], and [[Major Actor]]s and [[Minor Actor]]s appear with the cast of all involved roles that vary from protagonists to antagonists. From this point onwards, several [[Major Actor]]s will have play in every [[World Event]].

### Ascension of [[Legend]]s into the [[Stellar Legacy Score]]

_"What is known, lives. What is forgotten, dies. [[The Eternal Symphony]] remembers all."_

When a [[Legend]] dies, whether by [[Events]], combat, or of "old-age" when an age ends, their story is canonized as a musical bar of the [[Act of Fate]] of [[The Eternal Symphony]], and through the [[Stellar Legacy Score]], it can channel back to [[Arcanoria]] as a [[Constellation]]. Depending on their achievements and [[Lyrical Fragment]]s the [[Stellar Legacy Score]] assigns a [[Myth Grade]] to them:

- Historical: The [[Legend]] becomes a local patron, granting minor bonuses to their region of origin.
- Fabled: The [[Legend]] becomes a regional demigod, granting significant bonuses and active abilities through their [[Spellweaving]] memory.
- Mythic: The [[Legend]] becomes [[Civilization]] leading [[Constellation]], their influence weaving into the very fabric of [[Arcanoria]], granting domain-wide effects.

Furthermore, on an [[Age Transition]], [[Civilization]] is entitled to choose one of their strongest [[Legend Opus]]s to canonize as a [[World Truth]] — a permanent modifier for the next age. This [[World Truth]] reflects the [[Legend]]'s greatest impact during their lifetime and becomes an imprint of the [[Civilization]]'s history.

- _Example:_ If The King Who Knelt is canonized, in the next [[Ages]], a new religion or cultural tradition called "The Path of the Kneeling King" appears, granting Diplomacy bonuses to all followers.

[[Constellation]] have their own mechanics distinct from [[Legend]]s that make their [[Legend Opus]] and [[Legend Title]]s useful even after their passing. A [[Constellation]] is able to influence [[Civilization]] through three mechanics:

- [[Stellar Covenant]]s: Future [[Legend]]s can channel these [[Constellation]]s through [[Stellar Covenant]]s to gain temporary buffs, passive auras or unlock specific skills from that old [[Legend]]'s kit as an [[Inspiration Stigma]].
- [[Constellation Worship]]: Every action taken by a sponsored [[Legend]] generates [[Constellation Worship]], which is what increases a [[Constellation]]'s [[Resonance]] in the [[Stellar Legacy Score]], furthering their potency in [[Arcanoria]] and potentially improving its [[Myth Grade]] over time.
- [[Constellation Renown]]: With the passing of [[Ages]] [[Constellation]]s become more powerful, they gain renown by having presence in [[The Eternal Symphony]]. This makes [[Constellation]]s continue to accumulate power long after they had passed away. A [[Constellation]] of [[Ages]] 0 will always have more renown than one of [[Ages]] V if both aren't actively used. The most potent [[Constellation]]s in theory are your founding [[Legend]]s as they accumulate [[Constellation Renown]], even if in life they weren't as strong as modern [[Legend]]s.

This makes [[Constellation]]s the living score of [[The Eternal Symphony]], and prevents power creep by ensuring that a [[Constellation]] is as important as their [[Legend]]'s lifetime as it is across ages through their [[Stellar Covenants]] and usage. Thus, the formula for calculating a [[Constellation]] power is proportional to their [[Resonance]] which can be understood as:

$$\text{Constellation Resonance} = (\text{Legend Opus} + \text{Accumulated Worship}) \times \text{Renown}$$

This means:

- You had a first [[Legend]], who killed "The Shrieking Sentinel" [[Primal Discordia]] in [[Ages]] I, obtains the [[Slayer Magnum Opus]] of "First to Slay Fear."
- By Age V, they have been worshipped for four [[Ages]]. Their [[Resonance]] is massive.
- A new [[Legend]] in [[Ages]] V is born, and they too kill the reincarnation of that [[Atonalis]], but only gets Slayer of [[Anxithor]] — a weaker [[Legend Title]].
- The [[Ages]] V [[Legend]] might be a better fighter in their lifetime, and a more versatile [[Legend]] overall, but when they die and become a [[Constellation]], they will always be less powerful than "First to Slay Fear" because they started later.

This, however, does not mean a [[Constellation]] is locked forever, as the [[Ages]] V [[Constellation]] could have a stronger [[Inspiration Stigma]] because they did more during their lifetime. So [[Civilization]] has the option to stick to their current strong [[Constellation]] or adapt their successor until they amass the same accumulated [[Constellation Worship]] and [[Constellation Renown]] in a better unit.

Moreover, old [[Constellation]]s offer massive power but come with restrictions and possibly outdated mechanics unless you create [[Syncretism]] to force the story to change. This is meant to keep new [[Legend]]s from feeling like mere "users" of old power, [[Syncretism]] is aimed at combining two old [[Constellation]]s or one [[Constellation]] [[Magnum Opus]] effects with a newborn [[Legend]] to create a new score.

- _Action:_ Your new [[Legend]] has enough [[Legend Opus]] to channel "The King Who Knelt" (Peace) and "Impaler of [[The Silent Expanse]]" (War) simultaneously.    
- _The Result:_ You create a Dissonant, complex new [[Legend Opus]]: "The Peacemaker of the Blade."

This creates a new original [[Stellar Covenant]] and [[Inspiration Stigma]] of the hybrid kit. This ensures the "New" always adds something unique to the "Old" library.

Likewise, [[Syncretism]] can also come from mythic drift, as [[Constellation]]s are not static statues; they are echoes of [[Resonance]] that change based on how [[Civilization]] incarnates them. [[Arcanoria]] tracks contextual usage, and this allows organic evolution of the pantheon based on what's currently vital for society.

- _Scenario:_ You have the [[Constellation]] "Syvea, Mother of the Lost." A legendary healer that devoted their life to saving orphaned children.
- _Player Action:_ You keep using Syvea's healing miracles to keep soldiers alive in during war rather than saving orphans.

- _The Drift:_ After two [[Ages]] of this "misuse," Syvea's [[Legend Opus]] transforms:

    - _Old [[Legend Title]]:_ "Mother of the Lost."
    - _New [[Legend Title]]:_ "The Undying Matriarch of War."
    
- _Result:_ Her passive bonuses shift from "Population Growth" to "Army Recovery Rate." The player shaped the [[Constellation]] to fit their playstyle. This feels organic because they became what the [[Civilization]] needed by how and by whom she's remembered.

Your pantheon evolves based on how you play. If you abuse a Healing [[Constellation]] for military gain, the game mechanically twists that [[Constellation]] into a War [[Constellation]]. [[Arcanoria]] reacts to the [[Civilization]]'s hypocrisy and ingenuity, creating a "Living" religion.

**Example "Rags to Myth" Playthrough**

**Age I:** Syvea, an orphan with a [[Strand]] binding, loses her family to an [[Anxithor]] [[Atonalis]]. She vows to remember them, has a [[Motif Awakening]] to [[Strand]] and founds an orphanage that grows into a [[Enclave]]. She collects [[Fragments of Renewal]], eventually slays the [[Atonalis]] that was a [[Primal Discordia]], gaining the [[Slayer Magnum Opus]], and then forges the [[Magnum Opus]] "Mother of the Lost" by saving fellow [[Enclave]]s during the [[Great Plague]]. She became a [[Legend]] that saved many by both slaying the [[Primal Discordia]] and her healing [[Strand]] miracles during the [[Age Crisis]]. She eventually dies of old age during the [[Age Transition]] to [[Ages]] II and is canonized as a Historical [[Constellation]].

**Age II:** A new [[Legend]], Korran, forms a [[Stellar Covenant]] with Syvea's [[Constellation]], gaining the [[Inspiration Stigma]] "Aura of the Unafraid" (from Syvea's [[Slayer Magnum Opus]] "First to Slay Fear") Then Korran uses this to conquer territories, generating [[Constellation Worship]] for Syvea. Syvea's [[Myth Grade]] increases to Fabled.

**Age VII:** Syvea has changed into "The Undying Matriarch of War." she is now a Mythical-grade [[Constellation]]. Despite having changed her "Aura of the Unafraid" for warfare instead of healing, the [[World Truth]] she left is still valid "Orphanages grant +100% population growth." But through the transformation she's a great boost for [[Great Vanguard]]s, and the new [[Legend]] that forms a [[Stellar Covenant]] with her, gains several [[Inspiration Stigma]]s and a powerful boost to [[Strand]] magic.

This also proves the effect of the power creep fix, as that final [[Ages]] VII [[Legend]] is individually more powerful than Syvea ever was. But when they die and become a [[Constellation]], they will only be Historical-grade. They will need to be worshipped for 6 more [[Ages]] before they can match Syvea's Mythical-grade status unless they are explicitly used more to build their [[Constellation Renown]]. If none of them change, Syvea will always be ahead.

### Unique Aspects of the [[Stellar Legacy Score]]

**The "First Note" Anti-Power creep**

The first [[Legend]] to achieve a [[Slayer Magnum Opus]] feat is unique and unrepeatable in their founding myth. This ensures that early [[Legend]]s remain strategically vital, as their [[Constellation]]s accumulate [[Constellation Worship]] and [[Constellation Renown]] over [[Ages]], becoming more powerful than later [[Constellation]]s that might have similar but non-unique [[Legend Opus]]s.

**Narrative as a Resource**

The player is an author, not just the ruler of a [[Civilization]]. In [[Arcanoria]], you don't pick a leader, you write the leader and their [[Legend]]. By the end of a playthrough, you haven't just won a map, you have generated a fully coherent, 10,000-year [[Ages]] spanning mythology where "The [[Constellation]] of War" is actually that one orphan unit you saved in the magical stone age.

You create Einstein. You are Charlemagne. The [[Constellation]]s that [[Legend]]s of [[Ages]] X look up to, are the characters you struggled to keep alive in [[Ages]] I. The "Religion" of the modern era is based on the specific choices you made 50 hours ago. Players aren't just managing stats; they are curating a lineage of heroes.

**Dynamic Theology**

[[Constellation]]s are not static. If a [[Constellation]] is used in a way that contradicts its original story (e.g., a healing god used to sustain an unjust war), the [[Constellation]] may undergo the mythic drift from [[Syncretism]], changing its title and bonuses to reflect its new narrative context. The [[Stellar Legacy Score]] ensures that every [[Legend]]'s story matters, that every choice echoes through the [[Ages]], and that the players are not just rulers of empires, but authors of [[Constellation]]s. It is the system by which the past shapes the future, and the future remembers the past.

_"In the end, we are all stories. Make yours worth telling."_

### [[Legend Trait]]s and their importance

Every [[Legend]] begins not in victory or certainty, but in the devastating silence of loss. It's in that [[Motif Awakening]], broken, that their first note is struck. And from that instant, they become a bearer of a [[Soul Leitmotif]]. 

Every [[Soul-Key]] is a potential symphony. A [[Legend]] is one whose origin wound cracks them open, whose will chooses the melody, and whose weight gives the music its depth. Thus, [[Legend Trait]]s are the system that records the score of their identity and, it's too,  the first act of composition — the forging of a singular [[Consciousness]] whose life will write a bar into [[The Eternal Symphony]].

For every [[Legend]] it is their journey at their lowest that allows [[Spellweaving]] to exist, for every leader of [[Civilization]], and for the [[Constellation]]s they look up to in the night sky.

All [[Legend]]s have access to all magic types: [[Resonance]], [[Luminance]], [[Flux]], [[Void]], [[Cindergale]], [[Crystal]], [[Strand]]. However, the proficiency they have on each heavily depends on their [[Legend Trait]]s and represents their expertise. Based on said expertise they can perform actions while using the element as either a [[Minor Note]] in accompanying chords or as the [[Major Note]] root.

The binding score can range from 1 (Terrible) to 30+ (Master Level) and the score ranges in the following scale:

| **Score** | **Proficiency** | **[[Spellweaving]] Capability**                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–4       | Terrible        | Struggles to cast even [[Minor Note]] spells of that element; The binding is largely dormant.                                                        |
| 5–12      | Apprentice      | Basic magic, can cast [[Minor Note]]s of various rhythms and [[Major Note]]s of staccato spells ([[Unison]])                                         |
| 13–19     | Average         | Reliably casts [[Major Note]] of [[Unison]] spells and can create simple combinations of rhythms ([[Dyad]]s)                                         |
| 20–27     | Skilled         | Reliably creating [[Dyad]]s on certain rhythms, can start doing [[Triad Chord]]s with a [[Major Note]] of this binding.                              |
| 28-32     | Advanced        | Reliable advanced spells and expert combinations of [[Triad]] chords. Complete mastery of regular rhythms.                                           |
| 33–41     | Expert          | Master-level magic which introduced polyrhythms, yet proves hard to maintain [[Tetrad Chord]]s in sync.                                              |
| 42+       | Master          | Legendary spells with complete mastery of the binding, where reality begins to bends to their will. Only limited by the nature of [[Tetrad Chord]]s. |

This being said, it's important to distinguish that the [[Soul Leitmotif]] primary binding and the [[Ornament]]s tend to be the core of a [[Legend]]. It is possible to learn spells using other bindings, but they're much more prone to causing [[Discordant Interference]]. Since a [[Legend]]'s lifetime is limited too, a character is prone and more effective while specializing in only mastering the elements of their [[Soul Leitmotif]], with the occasional introduction of a fourth binding on situational scenarios or to achieve specific conditional spells.

### 1. The Wound - Origin and Physical [[Legend Trait]]s

Every [[Legend]] begins broken. The origin [[Legend Trait]]s represent the specific wound that will define their journey. These are not yet personality choices but rather the existential facts of every character's past. It is synchronized with their [[Soul Leitmotif]] and create narrative "goals" of overcoming certain weaknesses and fears. The origin traits aren't only backstories but also conditions which the character has to adapt to, from intelligence, to beauty, to family legacy. Certain traits are beneficial while others are negative. The whole point of a [[Legend]] is to overcome and utilize these traits to drive their growth and narrative.

There are three types of origin [[Legend Trait]]s which can be either advantages or disadvantages at birth, they include physical traits such as beauty, intelligence, or constitution, and also family legacies and ties to a backstory. This provides the framework of how the [[Legend]] is born and the obstacles they have to overcome, a naturally intelligent character will have an easier time learning, while a slow character will have to learn to deal with their lack of intelligence. Thus, the interplay of these [[Legend Trait]]s appears as the following framework:

- [[Dissonance]] Origins: Includes traits that actively harm the character start but pose a bonus of [[Lyrical Fragment]]s when dealing with core issues such as Orphan, which receives [[Fragment of Meaning]] and [[Resonance]] bonus when finding belonging, Sickly, which receives [[Fragment of Defiance]] and [[Cindergale]] bonus when resisting frailty, Exiled, which receives [[Fragment of Renewal]] and [[Strand]] bonus when reclaiming a place in society. Other traits like Lunatic give a negative to two random elements but it also helps for polyrhythms and chaotic spells, giving a bonus to this specific advanced magic.

- Standard Origins: Includes regular traits that are mostly benign or come with a few drawbacks like Ascetic which increases [[Fragment of Acceptance]]s from [[Essence Sacrifice]] or Healer which increases [[Flux]] and [[Strand]] but it places a [[Weight of Potential]] for serving the community. Similarly, unique traits like Sold Into Service work by increasing [[Luminance]] and [[Fragment of Lucidity]] at the cost of having to learn obedience and fulfilling someone else's wishes, diminishing [[Resonance]] and [[Flux]].

- [[Consonance]] Origins: Includes the good type of origins, which are advantages the character starts with such as Prodigy which gives a +3 bonus to all bindings, Brilliant which makes [[Luminance]] come naturally due to high intelligence or traits like aristocracy such as Born in the Purple which increases [[Strand]] and [[Resonance]] to being born into power. Most of these traits are net goods with few drawbacks but often come with a high [[Legend Trait]] cost.

[[Dissonance]] origins, physical disadvantages, and negative [[Legend Trait]]s however do have a hidden mechanic called the [[Underdog]] meter. Which upon reaching a certain threshold of negative [[Legend Trait]]s it increases the overall [[Lyrical Fragment]]s they receive. This creates a high-risk, high-reward scenario for trying to make the best [[Constellation]]s out of the hardest [[Legend]]s. While they are much more likely to fail, they have a greater growth curve. These are the two core values:

- [[Underdog]] Benefit: You already gain ×2 [[Lyrical Fragment]]s when you "punch above your station." And this bonus is stackable with personal origins, such as a peasant defeating a knight, a forsaken bastard earning noble standing, a poverty-stricken character amassing wealth. With this specific action, you generate up to ×3 [[Lyrical Fragment]]s from that action (×2 from [[Underdog]] and ×1 extra for being the Origin condition). This makes much more impactful having an Orphan finding belonging than a noble although it's much harder to execute.

- The [[Underdog]] Cost: [[Underdog]] [[Legend]]s start with lower binding scores and face higher failure thresholds, but their growth curve is exponential. By the time they become [[Constellation]]s, they are the most powerful figures in the [[Stellar Legacy Score]]. This also helps to align both roleplaying and min-maxing towards the same goal. The most narrative drama-rich and tragedy stories are also the ones generating the most amount of [[Lyrical Fragment]]s and [[Magnum Opus]]s.

Finally, this combination of elements creates the final piece of the [[Soul Leitmotif]]. The "Wish" that every [[Legend]] has. This appears from the first [[Motif Awakening]] that made the [[Legend]] a [[Spellweaver]]. In this sense, wishes connect to the crystallization of the primary binding and it's the binding [[Soul-Key]] that every [[Spellweaver]] "unconsciously choose." While the player explicitly finds a [[Motif Awakening]] according to the character they are roleplaying, these depend on [[The Principles of Magic]] and the seven bindings.

- _Example:_ An Exile of [[Dissonance]] origin has a [[Motif Awakening]] as "I wish to never be abandoned again" their primary binding and [[Soul Leitmotif]] awakens as [[Void]], since [[Essence Sacrifice]] is the one related to loss, self-worth, and value. This is the start of their journey and their [[Motif Awakening]] awakened from the death of a mentor who toke them in when no one else would. Thus, this is why they are feeling lonely again and wish to deal with their core wound of abandonment through a desire that became their [[Soul Leitmotif]].

A primary binding always gives +5 of proficiency to said element. It can be increased further by the development of the second type of [[Legend Trait]]s. 

### 2. The Expression - Personality [[Legend Trait]]s

Where origin and physical [[Legend Trait]]s define the wound and the conditions of the [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Consciousness]], personality [[Legend Trait]]s define the colors of the melody that emerges from it — the conscious and unconscious patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior that shape how a [[Legend]] engages with their world. These are not mere quirks, but harmonic dispositions which of the seven bindings they are naturally drawn to express that give both texture and character to a [[Legend]].

A [[Legend]] has exactly three personality [[Legend Trait]]s. These form the core thematic motifs of their character, and are the predisposition towards [[Ornament]]s that they have. Eventually, the [[Spellweaver]]'s personality [[Legend Trait]]s should point towards the same elements of their [[Soul Leitmotif]] primary binding and its two [[Ornament]]s. These personality [[Legend Trait]]s have the following properties:

- Baseline of a [[Legend]]'s Relational Patterns: Personality [[Legend Trait]]s operate as the core of who that character is, most of them are aimed at exploring which connections they're able to make within their worldview and, on [[Ballad]]s it unlocks major decisions. It also adds stakes to picking options that increase or decrease their [[Coherence]] (the stress of a character). A [[Legend]] with the Moody personality [[Legend Trait]] will struggle more with maintaining relationships where a character with the Coward [[Legend Trait]] will openly avoid conflict.

- Enriches the Emotional Texture of the Character: A second important point of [[Legend Trait]]s is that several personality types will create contradictions. These contradictions are meant to explore the depth and complexity of characters that can have two conflicting truths existing at the same time. This mirrors real-world character complexity where a [[Legend]] can be both Moody, has emotional swings that have complicated their life, and Callous, which is the emotional detachment as armor. This character developed a Callous [[Legend Trait]] not because they lacked emotion but because they needed to survive by not feeling, which is the condition they had with the Moody [[Legend Trait]].

- Attracts them Towards Certain [[Motif Awakening]]s as [[Ornament]]s: All personality [[Legend Trait]]s have a strength mixture of the seven bindings in [[The Principles of Magic]]. For example, the Moody trait is a [[Luminance]], [[Flux]], [[Void]] hybrid. This means that the Moody trait is the original unevolved state, depending on how the [[Legend]] learns to deal with it and grows with their wound they will achieve these ornaments. If they began to repress Moody but there comes a point where they have to finally face their overwhelming emotions after years of emotional suppression, this [[Motif Awakening]] will be to [[Flux]]. However, if they had been searching for clarity within chaos and their lack of emotional regulation lead them to harm through the disconnect between what they think and what they feel, they will search for the truth in their emotional chaos and a [[Motif Awakening]] to [[Luminance]] instead. Thus, all personality [[Legend Trait]]s are a blend of several elements that will eventually awaken as their [[Soul Leitmotif]] [[Ornament]]s.

- Guides Character Development into [[Apex Trait]]s: Most of the personality [[Legend Trait]]s begin with clear drawbacks, whether from the lack of emotional management that Moody gives or from Coward and inaction. Most of these traits are evolving traits, they are meant to appear as mutable states on the start of the journey of a [[Spellweaver]] but through their accomplishment, struggles, potential [[Motif Awakening]]s for [[Ornament]]s and by weaving [[Legend Title]]s and [[Legend Opus]]s into a better, valuable version of the original personality [[Legend Trait]]. For example, Coward is a mutable between [[Cindergale]], [[Crystal]] and [[Flux]]. Depending on the expression, it can eventually become the [[Apex Trait]] of Iron Will ([[Crystal]]), Inextinguishable Fire ([[Cindergale]]) or Unwavering Current ([[Flux]]). This signals both mechanical growth in [[Apex Trait]]s as much as it does character growth. Before becoming the [[Apex Trait]]s they tend to go in transition traits like the [[Cindergale]] path of Coward becoming first Flared and then evolving into its [[Apex Trait]] of Inextinguishable Fire. Thus, [[Apex Trait]]s represent the ultimate state that a [[Legend]] overcame in their journey.

Personality [[Legend Trait]]s are suitable for roleplaying and creating complex stories that give enough freedom through [[The Principles of Magic]] but grounded in mechanical focus. They are all aligned with a specific binding of the seven elements and start as potential multi binding traits that eventually solidify into a specific element, giving further mastery. They all come with their unique effects as well which heavily varies between [[Legend Trait]] and allow for extra decisions in the [[Fate Stage]] concerning the growth of each [[Legend]].

### 3. The Mastery - [[Spellweaving]] [[Legend Trait]]s

The actual [[Spellweaving]] related traits are the final tier of [[Legend Trait]]s and these are developed through the story of a [[Legend]]. They appear as the results, scars, achievements, and hard-won mastery of their lived experience. Where Origin and physical [[Legend Trait]]s represent the wounds that cracked and defined the start of their journey, and Personality [[Legend Trait]]s represent the melody in which they express themselves, The [[Spellweaving]] [[Legend Trait]]s are the proof that they have become more than they were.

These [[Legend Trait]]s are based on the actual [[Triadic Virtues of Spellcraft]], with a separation between [[Key of Attunement]] [[Legend Trait]]s ([[Resonance]]), [[Mastery Over Chaos]] [[Legend Trait]]s ([[Luminance]], [[Cindergale]], [[Crystal]]), and [[Potential of Creation]] [[Legend Trait]]s ([[Flux]], [[Void]], [[Strand]]). They each give bonuses, abilities, enhancements to [[Legend Opus]]s, and synergize with the unlocking of [[Legend Title]]s. Some of these are the result of investing [[Lyrical Fragment]]s and some are the outcomes of [[Ballad]]s and [[Magnum Opus]]s. 

A [[Legend]] does not choose to become "Masterful Tactician" — they become it by repeatedly winning battles against overwhelming odds until their [[Soul Leitmotif]] recognizes their achievement. Furthermore, some are unlocked specifically by an [[Ornament]]al [[Motif Awakening]], these are the [[Spellweaving]] equivalent of earning your [[Soul Leitmotif]]'s [[Ornament]]s — they represent growth of [[Consciousness]] crystallized into permanent capability.

The total sum of their combined [[Triadic Virtues of Spellcraft]] determines their overall mastery as a [[Spellweaver]] and combination between traits of different classes allows for more complex [[Triad Chord]] building. In [[Tetrad Chord]]s there will always be at least one element outside of their [[Triadic Virtues of Spellcraft]] group.

In essence, a [[Legend]] is a [[Consciousness]] choosing to transform their origin wound into creation, and the [[Legend Trait]] system records that choice and its consequences across three tiers:

1. **The Wound** — What was done to them
2. **The Expression** — How they chose to respond
3. **The Mastery** — What they became through that choice

From this emerges a [[Constellation]]—a permanent note in [[The Eternal Symphony]], influencing all [[Legend]]s who come after.

### Conversion to [[Constellation]]s

When a [[Legend]] dies, whether by [[Events]], combat, a [[Ballad]] or old age during an [[Age Transition]], they ascend to become [[Constellation]]s in the [[Stellar Legacy Score]]. While most of their [[Legend Trait]]s in life aren't converted, they do conserve several aspects of their core identity:

- Their core personality [[Legend Trait]] of whichever [[Apex Trait]] or closest they have to the primary binding of their [[Soul Leitmotif]]. Most of their identity is lost or mutable through the [[Ages]] or [[Syncretism]] but the pivot of their [[Soul-Key]] remains as constant.

- Their most valuable [[Spellweaving]] [[Legend Trait]], converting to an effect that increases the bonus of their [[Magnum Opus]]. Depending on the [[Legend]] [[Myth Grade]] they also obtain additional [[Spellweaving]] [[Legend Trait]]s, 1 more per each level. These are only obtainable effects during a [[Legend]]'s lifetime, making more valuable reaching high [[Myth Grade]] while they were alive and pushing early [[Legend]]s to take higher risk for the most mathematically powerful [[Constellation]].

- All of their [[Legend Title]]s and [[Legend Opus]], since it's primarily what they're remembered for, alongside with their origin [[Legend Trait]]s as the start of their story. While some of the details will become obscured with the passing of [[Ages]], they will retain their physical status at the peak of their [[Magnum Opus]]. If they died due to an illness, they will not inherit said illness.

On the case that a [[Legend]] becomes an [[Atonalis]] midway of their story, they will convert to a [[Constellation]] the moment said [[Atonalis]] is slain. If the [[Atonalis]] is still alive up to the [[Age Transition]] of the next [[Ages]], they will be slain automatically but will not award the bonus [[Legend Title]] and [[Legend Opus]] they would regularly give. Likewise, the [[Constellation]] will be based on their status as a [[Legend]] in their pre-[[Atonalis]] stage.
