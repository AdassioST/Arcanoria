Every [[Legend]] begins not in victory or certainty, but in the devastating silence of loss. It's in that [[Motif Awakening]], broken, that their first note is struck. And from that instant, they become a bearer of a [[Soul Leitmotif]]. 

Every [[Soul-Key]] is a potential symphony. A [[Legend]] is one whose origin wound cracks them open, whose will chooses the melody, and whose weight gives the music its depth. Thus, [[Legend Trait]]s are the system that records the score of their identity and, it's too,  the first act of composition — the forging of a singular [[Consciousness]] whose life will write a bar into [[The Eternal Symphony]].

For every [[Legend]] it is their journey at their lowest that allows [[Spellweaving]] to exist, for every leader of [[Civilization]], and for the [[Constellation]]s they look up to in the night sky.

All [[Legend]]s have access to all magic types: [[Resonance]], [[Luminance]], [[Flux]], [[Void]], [[Cindergale]], [[Crystal]], [[Strand]]. However, the proficiency they have on each heavily depends on their [[Legend Trait]]s and represents their expertise. Based on said expertise they can perform actions while using the element as either a [[Minor Note]] in accompanying chords or as the [[Major Note]] root.

The binding score can range from 1 (Terrible) to 30+ (Master Level) and the score ranges in the following scale:

| **Score** | **Proficiency** | **[[Spellweaving]] Capability**                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–4       | Terrible        | Struggles to cast even [[Minor Note]] spells of that element; The binding is largely dormant.                                                        |
| 5–12      | Apprentice      | Basic magic, can cast [[Minor Note]]s of various rhythms and [[Major Note]]s of staccato spells ([[Unison]])                                         |
| 13–19     | Average         | Reliably casts [[Major Note]] of [[Unison]] spells and can create simple combinations of rhythms ([[Dyad]]s)                                         |
| 20–27     | Skilled         | Reliably creating [[Dyad]]s on certain rhythms, can start doing [[Triad Chord]]s with a [[Major Note]] of this binding.                              |
| 28-32     | Advanced        | Reliable advanced spells and expert combinations of [[Triad Chord]]s. Complete mastery of regular rhythms.                                           |
| 33–41     | Expert          | Master-level magic which introduced polyrhythms, yet proves hard to maintain [[Tetrad Chord]]s in sync.                                              |
| 42+       | Master          | Legendary spells with complete mastery of the binding, where reality begins to bends to their will. Only limited by the nature of [[Tetrad Chord]]s. |

This being said, it's important to distinguish that the [[Soul Leitmotif]] primary binding and the [[Ornament]]s tend to be the core of a [[Legend]]. It is possible to learn spells using other bindings, but they're much more prone to causing [[Discordant Interference]]. Since a [[Legend]]'s lifetime is limited too, a character is prone and more effective while specializing in only mastering the elements of their [[Soul Leitmotif]], with the occasional introduction of a fourth binding on situational scenarios or to achieve specific conditional spells.

### 1. The Wound - Origin and Physical [[Legend Trait]]s

Every [[Legend]] begins broken. The origin [[Legend Trait]]s represent the specific wound that will define their journey. These are not yet personality choices but rather the existential facts of every character's past. It is synchronized with their [[Soul Leitmotif]] and create narrative "goals" of overcoming certain weaknesses and fears. The origin traits aren't only backstories but also conditions which the character has to adapt to, from intelligence, to beauty, to family legacy. Certain traits are beneficial while others are negative. The whole point of a [[Legend]] is to overcome and utilize these traits to drive their growth and narrative.

There are three types of origin [[Legend Trait]]s which can be either advantages or disadvantages at birth, they include physical traits such as beauty, intelligence, or constitution, and also family legacies and ties to a backstory. This provides the framework of how the [[Legend]] is born and the obstacles they have to overcome, a naturally intelligent character will have an easier time learning, while a slow character will have to learn to deal with their lack of intelligence. Thus, the interplay of these [[Legend Trait]]s appears as the following framework:

- [[Dissonance]] Origins: Includes traits that actively harm the character start but pose a bonus of [[Lyrical Fragment]]s when dealing with core issues such as Orphan, which receives [[Fragment of Meaning]] and [[Resonance]] bonus when finding belonging, Sickly, which receives [[Fragment of Defiance]] and [[Cindergale]] bonus when resisting frailty, Exiled, which receives [[Fragment of Renewal]] and [[Strand]] bonus when reclaiming a place in society. Other traits like Lunatic give a negative to two random elements but it also helps for polyrhythms and chaotic spells, giving a bonus to this specific advanced magic.

- Standard Origins: Includes regular traits that are mostly benign or come with a few drawbacks like Ascetic which increases [[Fragment of Acceptance]]s from [[Essence Sacrifice]] or Healer which increases [[Flux]] and [[Strand]] but it places a [[Weight of Potential]] for serving the community. Similarly, unique traits like Sold Into Service work by increasing [[Luminance]] and [[Fragment of Lucidity]] at the cost of having to learn obedience and fulfilling someone else's wishes, diminishing [[Resonance]] and [[Flux]].

- [[Consonance]] Origins: Includes the good type of origins, which are advantages the character starts with such as Prodigy which gives a +3 bonus to all bindings, Brilliant which makes [[Luminance]] come naturally due to high intelligence or traits like aristocracy such as Born in the Purple which increases [[Strand]] and [[Resonance]] to being born into power. Most of these traits are net goods with few drawbacks but often come with a high [[Legend Trait]] cost.

[[Dissonance]] origins, physical disadvantages, and negative [[Legend Trait]]s however do have a hidden mechanic called the [[Underdog]] meter. Which upon reaching a certain threshold of negative [[Legend Trait]]s it increases the overall [[Lyrical Fragment]]s they receive. This creates a high-risk, high-reward scenario for trying to make the best [[Constellation]]s out of the hardest [[Legend]]s. While they are much more likely to fail, they have a greater growth curve. These are the two core values:

- [[Underdog]] Benefit: You already gain ×2 [[Lyrical Fragment]]s when you "punch above your station." And this bonus is stackable with personal origins, such as a peasant defeating a knight, a forsaken bastard earning noble standing, a poverty-stricken character amassing wealth. With this specific action, you generate up to ×3 [[Lyrical Fragment]]s from that action (×2 from [[Underdog]] and ×1 extra for being the Origin condition). This makes much more impactful having an Orphan finding belonging than a noble although it's much harder to execute.

- The [[Underdog]] Cost: [[Underdog]] [[Legend]]s start with lower binding scores and face higher failure thresholds, but their growth curve is exponential. By the time they become [[Constellation]]s, they are the most powerful figures in the [[Stellar Legacy Score]]. This also helps to align both roleplaying and min-maxing towards the same goal. The most narrative drama-rich and tragedy stories are also the ones generating the most amount of [[Lyrical Fragment]]s and [[Magnum Opus]]s.

Finally, this combination of elements creates the final piece of the [[Soul Leitmotif]]. The "Wish" that every [[Legend]] has. This appears from the first [[Motif Awakening]] that made the [[Legend]] a [[Spellweaver]]. In this sense, wishes connect to the crystallization of the primary binding and it's the binding [[Soul-Key]] that every [[Spellweaver]] "unconsciously choose." While the player explicitly finds a [[Motif Awakening]] according to the character they are roleplaying, these depend on [[The Principles of Magic]] and the seven bindings.

- _Example:_ An Exile of [[Dissonance]] origin has a [[Motif Awakening]] as "I wish to never be abandoned again" their primary binding and [[Soul Leitmotif]] awakens as [[Void]], since [[Essence Sacrifice]] is the one related to loss, self-worth, and value. This is the start of their journey and their [[Motif Awakening]] awakened from the death of a mentor who toke them in when no one else would. Thus, this is why they are feeling lonely again and wish to deal with their core wound of abandonment through a desire that became their [[Soul Leitmotif]].

A primary binding always gives +5 of proficiency to said element. It can be increased further by the development of the second type of [[Legend Trait]]s. 

### 2. The Expression - Personality [[Legend Trait]]s

Where origin and physical [[Legend Trait]]s define the wound and the conditions of the [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Consciousness]], personality [[Legend Trait]]s define the colors of the melody that emerges from it — the conscious and unconscious patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior that shape how a [[Legend]] engages with their world. These are not mere quirks, but harmonic dispositions which of the seven bindings they are naturally drawn to express that give both texture and character to a [[Legend]].

A [[Legend]] has exactly three personality [[Legend Trait]]s. These form the core thematic motifs of their character, and are the predisposition towards [[Ornament]]s that they have. Eventually, the [[Spellweaver]]'s personality [[Legend Trait]]s should point towards the same elements of their [[Soul Leitmotif]] primary binding and its two [[Ornament]]s. These personality [[Legend Trait]]s have the following properties:

- Baseline of a [[Legend]]'s Relational Patterns: Personality [[Legend Trait]]s operate as the core of who that character is, most of them are aimed at exploring which connections they're able to make within their worldview and, on [[Ballad]]s it unlocks major decisions. It also adds stakes to picking options that increase or decrease their [[Coherence]] (the stress of a character). A [[Legend]] with the Moody personality [[Legend Trait]] will struggle more with maintaining relationships where a character with the Coward [[Legend Trait]] will openly avoid conflict.

- Enriches the Emotional Texture of the Character: A second important point of [[Legend Trait]]s is that several personality types will create contradictions. These contradictions are meant to explore the depth and complexity of characters that can have two conflicting truths existing at the same time. This mirrors real-world character complexity where a [[Legend]] can be both Moody, has emotional swings that have complicated their life, and Callous, which is the emotional detachment as armor. This character developed a Callous [[Legend Trait]] not because they lacked emotion but because they needed to survive by not feeling, which is the condition they had with the Moody [[Legend Trait]].

- Attracts them Towards Certain [[Motif Awakening]]s as [[Ornament]]s: All personality [[Legend Trait]]s have a strength mixture of the seven bindings in [[The Principles of Magic]]. For example, the Moody trait is a [[Luminance]], [[Flux]], [[Void]] hybrid. This means that the Moody trait is the original unevolved state, depending on how the [[Legend]] learns to deal with it and grows with their wound they will achieve these ornaments. If they began to repress Moody but there comes a point where they have to finally face their overwhelming emotions after years of emotional suppression, this [[Motif Awakening]] will be to [[Flux]]. However, if they had been searching for clarity within chaos and their lack of emotional regulation lead them to harm through the disconnect between what they think and what they feel, they will search for the truth in their emotional chaos and a [[Motif Awakening]] to [[Luminance]] instead. Thus, all personality [[Legend Trait]]s are a blend of several elements that will eventually awaken as their [[Soul Leitmotif]] [[Ornament]]s.

- Guides Character Development into [[Apex Trait]]s: Most of the personality [[Legend Trait]]s begin with clear drawbacks, whether from the lack of emotional management that Moody gives or from Coward and inaction. Most of these traits are evolving traits, they are meant to appear as mutable states on the start of the journey of a [[Spellweaver]] but through their accomplishment, struggles, potential [[Motif Awakening]]s for [[Ornament]]s and by weaving [[Legend Title]]s and [[Legend Opus]]s into a better, valuable version of the original personality [[Legend Trait]]. For example, Coward is a mutable between [[Cindergale]], [[Crystal]] and [[Flux]]. Depending on the expression, it can eventually become the [[Apex Trait]] of Iron Will ([[Crystal]]), Inextinguishable Fire ([[Cindergale]]) or Unwavering Current ([[Flux]]). This signals both mechanical growth in [[Apex Trait]]s as much as it does character growth. Before becoming the [[Apex Trait]]s they tend to go in transition traits like the [[Cindergale]] path of Coward becoming first Flared and then evolving into its [[Apex Trait]] of Inextinguishable Fire. Thus, [[Apex Trait]]s represent the ultimate state that a [[Legend]] overcame in their journey.

Personality [[Legend Trait]]s are suitable for roleplaying and creating complex stories that give enough freedom through [[The Principles of Magic]] but grounded in mechanical focus. They are all aligned with a specific binding of the seven elements and start as potential multi binding traits that eventually solidify into a specific element, giving further mastery. They all come with their unique effects as well which heavily varies between [[Legend Trait]] and allow for extra decisions in the [[Fate Stage]] concerning the growth of each [[Legend]].

### 3. The Mastery - [[Spellweaving]] [[Legend Trait]]s

The actual [[Spellweaving]] related traits are the final tier of [[Legend Trait]]s and these are developed through the story of a [[Legend]]. They appear as the results, scars, achievements, and hard-won mastery of their lived experience. Where Origin and physical [[Legend Trait]]s represent the wounds that cracked and defined the start of their journey, and Personality [[Legend Trait]]s represent the melody in which they express themselves, The [[Spellweaving]] [[Legend Trait]]s are the proof that they have become more than they were.

These [[Legend Trait]]s are based on the actual [[Triadic Virtues of Spellcraft]], with a separation between [[Key of Attunement]] [[Legend Trait]]s ([[Resonance]]), [[Mastery Over Chaos]] [[Legend Trait]]s ([[Luminance]], [[Cindergale]], [[Crystal]]), and [[Potential of Creation]] [[Legend Trait]]s ([[Flux]], [[Void]], [[Strand]]). They each give bonuses, abilities, enhancements to [[Legend Opus]]s, and synergize with the unlocking of [[Legend Title]]s. Some of these are the result of investing [[Lyrical Fragment]]s and some are the outcomes of [[Ballad]]s and [[Magnum Opus]]s. 

A [[Legend]] does not choose to become "Masterful Tactician" — they become it by repeatedly winning battles against overwhelming odds until their [[Soul Leitmotif]] recognizes their achievement. Furthermore, some are unlocked specifically by an [[Ornament]]al [[Motif Awakening]], these are the [[Spellweaving]] equivalent of earning your [[Soul Leitmotif]]'s [[Ornament]]s — they represent growth of [[Consciousness]] crystallized into permanent capability.

The total sum of their combined [[Triadic Virtues of Spellcraft]] determines their overall mastery as a [[Spellweaver]] and combination between traits of different classes allows for more complex [[Triad Chord]] building. In [[Tetrad Chord]]s there will always be at least one element outside of their [[Triadic Virtues of Spellcraft]] group.

In essence, a [[Legend]] is a [[Consciousness]] choosing to transform their origin wound into creation, and the [[Legend Trait]] system records that choice and its consequences across three tiers:

1. **The Wound** — What was done to them
2. **The Expression** — How they chose to respond
3. **The Mastery** — What they became through that choice

From this emerges a [[Constellation]]—a permanent note in [[The Eternal Symphony]], influencing all [[Legend]]s who come after.

### Conversion to [[Constellation]]s

When a [[Legend]] dies, whether by [[Events]], combat, a [[Ballad]] or old age during an [[Age Transition]], they ascend to become [[Constellation]]s in the [[Stellar Legacy Score]]. While most of their [[Legend Trait]]s in life aren't converted, they do conserve several aspects of their core identity:

- Their core personality [[Legend Trait]] of whichever [[Apex Trait]] or closest they have to the primary binding of their [[Soul Leitmotif]]. Most of their identity is lost or mutable through the [[Ages]] or [[Syncretism]] but the pivot of their [[Soul-Key]] remains as constant.

- Their most valuable [[Spellweaving]] [[Legend Trait]], converting to an effect that increases the bonus of their [[Magnum Opus]]. Depending on the [[Legend]] [[Myth Grade]] they also obtain additional [[Spellweaving]] [[Legend Trait]]s, 1 more per each level. These are only obtainable effects during a [[Legend]]'s lifetime, making more valuable reaching high [[Myth Grade]] while they were alive and pushing early [[Legend]]s to take higher risk for the most mathematically powerful [[Constellation]].

- All of their [[Legend Title]]s and [[Legend Opus]], since it's primarily what they're remembered for, alongside with their origin [[Legend Trait]]s as the start of their story. While some of the details will become obscured with the passing of [[Ages]], they will retain their physical status at the peak of their [[Magnum Opus]]. If they died due to an illness, they will not inherit said illness.

On the case that a [[Legend]] becomes an [[Atonalis]] midway of their story, they will convert to a [[Constellation]] the moment said [[Atonalis]] is slain. If the [[Atonalis]] is still alive up to the [[Age Transition]] of the next [[Ages]], they will be slain automatically but will not award the bonus [[Legend Title]] and [[Legend Opus]] they would regularly give. Likewise, the [[Constellation]] will be based on their status as a [[Legend]] in their pre-[[Atonalis]] stage.
