A device using encased mirrors to catch light, it is widely used as the only way to capture [[Aetherlight]] but it can also be used for other purposes for giving form to the formless.

Thus, it is also a useful device for ensnaring [[Pure Light]] creatures and with enough engineering mastery it's able to even catch an [[Outer God]] in [[Anthropomorphic Shape]] as a [[Celestial Ensnaring Mirror]]. [[Selenea]] is the first of such beings when she was betrayed by the [[Auric Aria]] and captured into the [[Moon]].
