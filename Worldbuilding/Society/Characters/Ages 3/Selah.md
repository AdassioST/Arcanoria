[[Lacrimosa]]'s right hand, the most pious cultist, first wing of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]] and founder of the [[Purest of Love]]. She is a core antagonist that began as a pious follower of the [[Auric Aria]] but then turned to create the movement of the pilgrims of the [[Auroral Ribbons]].

Struggles with finding meaning in chaos, and societal collapse: _"There has to be a meaning for all of these deaths. For all of my suffering too, I don't know the explanation but I trust that it is plan of the divine."_

She represents the "Crisis Cult" leader—the figure who translates mass trauma into organized religion. She is a direct mirror in opposition of [[Father Aldric]].

### The Crisis of Faith (The Silence of the [[Auric Aria]])

[[Selah]] begins as a "pious of the [[Auric Aria]]." The "Father Aldric" text confirms that the [[Auric Aria]]’s "crystalline clarity" has vanished.   

- **The Unanswered Prayer:** The Plague kills the faithful and the faithless alike. The "[[Auric Heptacode]]" (Order) has failed. [[Selah]] prays to [[Auric Aria]], and [[Auric Aria]] is silent. This "Divine Silence"  creates a vacuum.   
    
- **The Cognitive Dissonance:** When a believer’s worldview is shattered by catastrophe, they rarely abandon faith; they _radicalize_ it or _shift_ it. [[Selah]] cannot accept that "suffering is random." She _needs_ to "make meaning of all the deaths."   
    

### 6.2 The Logic of the "[[Moon]] Weeping"

[[Selah]] looks to the sky and sees the [[Auroral Ribbons]] ([[Lacrimosa]]’s tears) glistening in a gold that mirrors the [[Auric Aria]] described manifestation when the dying pass through them. She interprets this not as a cosmic anomaly, but as a sign.

- **The New Doctrine:** "The Heavens are weeping." This reframes the Plague. It is no longer "punishment" ([[Auric Aria]]’s view) but "shared sorrow" ([[Lacrimosa]]’s view).
    
- **Why this works:** For a grieving mother or a widow (like the families [[Selah]] recruits), a Weeping God is infinitely more comforting than a Silent God. A Weeping God validates their pain.
    

### 6.3 [[Selah]] as the Facilitator of Hollowing

[[Selah]] facilitates the ritual that binds [[Mira]] to [[Lacrimosa]] at first, creating the first [[Anthropomorphic Shape]] albeit in a vessel. And then through the Dreamweaver legend she finally creates a [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]] to make [[Lacrimosa]]'s existence permanent in [[Arcanoria]]. She is the second hand of the Messiah.

- **The "[[Purest of Love]]":** [[Selah]] coins the phrase. It defines "love" not as "passion" (which hurts when lost) but as "merger" (which cannot be lost).
    
- **The Cult Formation:** The "Pilgrims of the [[Auroral Ribbons]]" are a classic "Crisis Cult." They target the vulnerable (Plague survivors), offer a new explanation for their pain (The Moon Weeps), and provide a mechanism for relief ([[Lunehymn]]/[[The Hollowing]]).   
    
- **Conclusion on [[Selah]]:** Her arc is a textbook sociological progression. She is the "Entrepreneur of Meaning" in a market crashed by death.
