 _Loss is transformation. The game is not about preventing loss. It's about what you do with loss after it happens._

The magical Earth where the game takes place, its origin lies in the [[Seven-Day Creation]] by the [[Auric Aria]].

### Map Features

The map features and types are:

- **Settlements**: They are the [[Civilization]] at its core, and depending on their development and growth they have the following categories:

	- [[Capital]]s: One per empire and it's the one you have zoomed-in view of. They are the center of bureaucracy and hold the [[Government Council]].  They anchor all [[Administrative Authority]] and all other settlements must ultimately connect to [[Capital]] [[Administrative Authority]]. The [[Government Capacity]] can be expanded through [[Capital]] improvements.
	
	- [[Major Settlement]]s: A [[Civilization]] can hold as many as their [[Government Capacity]] allows. These are the major cities of the [[Civilization]], they are attuned to a specialization with one of the seven bindings of [[The Principles of Magic]]. They serve as major anchors for projecting [[Administrative Authority]]. After learning [[The Truth of Arcanoria]], they can develop up to two [[Ornament]]s depending on the [[Major Settlement]]'s history. Requires being entirely present during at least three [[Ages]]. A fully [[Ornament]]al city can perform advanced [[Spellweaving]], including [[Tetrad Chord]]s. Likewise, [[Major Settlement]]s create secondary zones of control around them, and all [[Developing Town]]s within range must connect to them.
	
	- [[Developing Town]]s: They have unlimited capacity, although they always have to be within the [[Civilization]]'s [[Administrative Authority]] and with enough distance of other settlements. All [[Major Settlement]]s begin as [[Developing Town]]s. They serve as expansion engines and resource collectors, and distance limits prevent sprawl while encouraging focused empire development. [[Developing Town]]s can be promoted to a [[Major Settlement]] when they reach enough [[City Development]].
	
	- [[Outpost]]: Any remote station or settlement established detached of the core [[Administrative Authority]] of a [[Civilization]] with the purpose of having access to trade or extract additional [[Resources]], overseas [[Administrative Authority]], or redirect the flow of [[Leylines]] through [[Resonance Anchors]] to increase the [[Coherence]] of a region. Can be upgraded to become [[Developing Town]]s if incorporated into [[Administrative Authority]].
	
- **Trade and Supply Chains**: These are the lifeblood of any [[Civilization]] and have varying degrees of specialization for the production, manufacturing, and economic power of goods. They count from trade routes to domestic logistics.

	- [[Trade Nexus]]: The main geographic-economic hubs where all trade in a region is connected. These are large locations for trading where markets, warehouses, and customs conduct [[Trade Power]]. All [[Trade Routes]] connect from [[Trade Nodes]] to [[Trade Nexus]] to any settlement type. They are the primary economic [[Landmark]]s that create value and [[City Development]] but require a gifted geographical feature to establish. _"One connected [[Trade Nexus]] is worth three isolated cities."_
	
	- [[Trade Nodes]]: The in-between points for [[Trade Routes]] that connect infrastructure, supply, [[Resources]], and goods. They're the check-points of economic highways. Controlling [[Trade Node]]s means controlling trade flow unless provided with an alternative route, but usually disrupting a [[Trade Node]] disrupts the entire route. They can be fortified to increase the safety of [[Trade Routes]].
	
	- [[Trade Routes]]: The zones where [[Resources]] travel from [[Trade Nodes]]. They can connect two [[Trade Nodes]], any [[Trade Nodes]] to a [[Trade Nexus]], and [[Trade Nodes]] to any settlement. The pathways between [[Trade Routes]] prefer to travel in high [[Coherence]] zones along [[Leylines]], and the roads they build tend to increase the adjacent [[City Development]]. [[Trade Routes]] can only be disrupted by a [[Blockade]] or [[Pillaging]] on a [[Trade Node]].

- **Magical Pathways and Hotspots**: [[Arcanoria]] also has a secondary layer of harmonics that allows as the magical network and landscape of the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] which changes every [[Ages]] transition as the [[Grand Thread Rings]] move in [[Cosmic Motion]]. The features that are embedded within the map as the magical layer are the following:

	- [[Leylines]]: Magical pathways that form a network across the world. They are natural channels of magical energy that [[Civilization]]s can leverage for power, information, travel and research. [[Leylines]] are the highest naturally occurring [[Coherence]]. Units move faster when traveling on [[Leylines]], seers reveal farther and [[Trade Routes]] receive yield bonuses. High [[Coherence]] regions are necessary for [[Major Settlement]]s and [[Capital]]s to fully develop. They are visible as glowing paths that can be traced visually across terrain, and tend to follow running bodies of water like rivers. The intersections and convergence points act as fertile land of "magical highways" for powerful [[Spellweaving]] and enable civilization-wide magical bonuses.
	
	- High and Low [[Coherence]] Zones: All regions have an assigned value of magical stability, increase through the natural [[Leylines]] and [[Vibrational Density]] of the world. Certain structures, such as [[Resonance Anchors]] can increase [[Coherence]]. Depending on if it's positive or negative it can amplify or dampen magical effects. Zones with high [[Coherence]] allow for reliable [[Spellweaving]], easier [[City Development]], and increase in the efficiency of [[Trade Routes]]. Zones with low [[Coherence]] do the opposite, and decrease the [[Composure]] of adjacent armies, serving as attrition zones.
	
	- [[Vibrational Density]] and [[Sacred Site]]s: Regions with the highest harmonic integrity are considered [[Sacred Site]]s because they have a paramount potency for [[Spellweaving]] and attunement. These are very scarce [[Landmark]]s but are necessary for establishing a [[Religion]] through a [[Prophet]]. These legendary sites allow for the most [[Piety]] to transfer into [[Civilization]], they're the highest [[Coherence]] point of all of [[Arcanoria]] and are immune to most [[Dissonance]] effects. [[Atonalis]] avoid entirely these places. While the quality of [[Vibrational Density]] for a [[Sacred Site]] is the maximum possible, minor theological settlements like [[Religious Haven]]s have increased yields depending on the [[Vibrational Density]] of the place, leading some to be better than others at generating [[Faith]] and [[Piety]]. [[Sacred Site]]s don't change with [[Ages]] as the rest of the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] does.

- **[[Resource Grandfield]]s:** Vast areas of [[Resources]] that can increase the existing production of a category of [[Resources]]. These are large patches of crystalized matter that can be used for increasing tenfold the output of current [[Production Units]]. They are sparse and require a dedicated extraction [[Outpost]]. However, they are very valuable [[Landmark]]s that vary based on whether they are [[Resource Grandfield]]s of [[Building Materials]] or [[Vital Resources]].

- **[[Enclave]]s**: A type of autonomous self-governing authority specialized in a particular activity that vary based on the [[Ages]] they're currently in. While [[Enclave]]s evolve over time, they have diplomacy distinct from other [[Civilization]]s or proper empires as they're city-states that can be interacted and integrated within a [[Civilization]].

### Enclaves (City-states) as Middle Ground between [[Civilization]]s, and other settlements.

A type of autonomous self-governing authority specialized in a particular activity that vary based on the [[Ages]] they're currently in. While [[Enclave]]s evolve over time, they have diplomacy distinct from other [[Civilization]]s or proper empires as they're city-states that can be interacted and integrated within a [[Civilization]]. Regardless of the type of [[Enclave]] they all shared the following:

- **Primary Function:** It's the essence of the [[Enclave]], and their vision statement. It's deeply related to their origin wound and serves as the purpose. A luminous observatory has the primary function of research advancement and technological discovery because truth is the highest calling. A forge-city with the essence of excellence through absolute concentration allows manufacturing and specialized crafting.

- **Economic Specialization:** What activities the [[Enclave]] specializes in to fulfil their primary function. it can range in many ways depending on the way each [[Enclave]] has encoded one of the seven bindings of [[The Principles of Magic]], going from cultural exports, to diplomatic missions, to baking bread. And even two [[Enclave]]s with a similar primary function can change significantly based on their wound and binding as it influences dramatically their activities.

- **Unique Mechanics:** These are gameplay mechanics that surround [[Enclave]]s, some affect missions, bonus effects, diplomacy, and [[Suzerainty]] bonuses. For example, an [[Indulgent Enclave]] specialized in harmonic [[Resonance]] broadcasts offers [[Civilization]]s a "cultural frequency" that other settlements attune to. If the [[Civilization]] chooses to adopt this frequency, they gain happiness and cultural generation but lose some autonomy where they can't adopt certain cultural policies without the [[Indulgent Enclave]]'s approval.

- **Integration Bonuses:** When [[Enclave]]s are integrated into a [[Civilization]] through a merger diplomatic resolution, or sustain an expanded [[Suzerainty]] status, they don't cede their autonomy, instead on integration they retain their uniqueness. The same [[Indulgent Enclave]] when integrated grants the parent [[Civilization]] a permanent +25% cultural generation globally and unlocks "Harmonized" reforms that reduce inter-settlement tensions.

- **Origin Wound:** This is the narrative foundation, world-building flavor and the "Why" of [[Enclave]]s. In a nutshell, [[Enclave]]s are formed as communities of [[Spellweaver]]s trying to find meaning on hardship and communal trauma. The [[Indulgent Enclave]] could be a society formed by refugees of artistic repression fleeing tyranny, or survivors of cultural genocide seeking to preserve memory in a new form. A bakery [[Enclave]] could be formed from a beloved baker who was executed during plague panic as a scapegoat. The family refuses to let them be forgotten and they begin building a bakery community that eventually becomes an [[Enclave]] which serves as a memorial (recipes preserve their memory), a cultural sanctuary (people gather, share stories) and a source of happiness.

### Evolution of [[Enclave]]s across [[Ages]]

Likewise, [[Enclave]]s are not static societies, they tend to have an advanced technological niche that keeps them relevant as autonomous sovereign states, and depending on their history through the [[Events]] [[Civilization]] encounters and their leaders their origin wound can manifest in several expressions too:

- **Healing Path** – Wound processed, enclave becomes integrated, stable.
- **Acceptance Path** – Wound acknowledged and woven into identity.
- **Denial Path** – Wound ignored; obsession, overcompensation.
- **Weaponization Path** – Wound turned into power (revenge, extremism).

An underlying wound can be either a wholesome healing community (sharing recipes, building solidarity) or an obsessive cult-like [[Enclave]] (unhealthy fixation on legacy). This flexibility is intentional: it supports tone diversity from cozy to grim. This is further supported by the [[Enclave]]'s [[Wound Resonance]]. A conceptual 0–100 scale describing how strongly the enclave is still “powered” by its founding trauma. It exists in three states:

- **75–100** – Raw, acute trauma: Maximum output, but unstable and prone to obsession or weaponization.

- **40–75** – Integrated wound: Stable production, strong identity, healthiest state.

- **0–40** – Forgotten wound: [[Enclave]] becomes susceptible to dissolution or fall; loses uniqueness progressively and it's usually a death sentence, but it is also the reformation period for a new [[Enclave]] to emerge from the ashes.

Finally, if there are enough [[Ages]] of a stable [[Enclave]] without [[Suzerainty]] or integration into a [[Civilization]]. They can evolve to become their own [[Civilization]]. [[Enclave]]s also serve to fill the niche of new forming [[Civilization]]s and empires that aren't yet established on game start, and if given enough authority, [[City Development]], and lack of integration, they will become another player in [[Arcanoria]].

### The Horizontal Worldbuilding of [[Enclave]]s

[[Enclave]]s are varied having both a general category of activities across 10 groups, and a binding alignment. Categories describe the [[Enclave]]'s functional niche in [[Arcanoria]]. The list of the categories is the following:

- [[Agromagical Enclave]]: Growth, Health, Sanitation, Sustenance.
- [[Militant Enclave]]: Tactics, Weapons, Mercenaries, Hunters.
- [[Auric Enclave]]: [[Aureus Pillar]], [[Piety]], [[Faith]], Knowledge, Science.
- [[Weaver Enclave]]: [[Waltz Pillar]], Culture, Poetry, Songs, Communal Arts.
- [[Domestication Enclave]]: Creatures, [[Pure Light]], Taming, Druids.
- [[Trading Enclave]]: Economics, Wealth, [[Resources]], Efficiency. 
- [[Industrious Enclave]]: Equipment, Forges, Artisans, Metalworks.
- [[Regal Enclave]]: [[Regalia Pillar]], Politics, Diplomacy, Prestige, Espionage.
- [[Indulgent Enclave]]: Entertainment, Pleasure, Joy, Luxuries,
- [[Esoteric Enclave]]: [[Chorus Pillar]], [[Outer God]]s, Dark [[Magic Arts]], Witchcraft, Spirits.

Furthermore, each [[Enclave]] can be tuned with a binding affecting their flavor. As the same [[Enclave]] with a different binding changes their perception and behavior of their original wound. For example, a [[Militant Enclave]] with [[Cindergale]] becomes a fast, aggressive, high-risk cavalry, while one with [[Crystal]] is instead of impregnable defensive lines and long-term planning, or a [[Void]] is elite units with devastating [[Spellweaving]] but are hard to manage and usually incur heavy losses.

Besides their flavor [[Enclave]]s also offer varying narrative storylines on the proximity of the [[Civilization]] which have developing [[Legend]]s that can be influenced through diplomacy, trade, and decision-making storylines. This gives an added bonus of having a look at the rest of the world, and increase the horizontal development of the worldbuilding. The [[Enclave]] system is designed to produce every major function of [[Civilization]] while having enough tone flexibility to have wholesome, bittersweet, or dark themes, and the emergent narratives arise from the combination of the properties of [[Enclave]]s, their relationships with one another, the [[Trade Routes]] and their influence in [[Trade Nexus]].

This varying category can be set along a spectrum where the same activities can be either pure wholesome in healing, joy, connection, kindness, or as pure dark with exploitation, obsession, and despair. The varying degrees of versatility have any type of [[Enclave]] adjusting by their narrative development, their responses to [[Dark Age]] and [[Golden Age]]s, and the [[Age Crisis]] as an origin wound to either their foundation or their response. A few examples of these degrees can be understood like this:

- [[Weaver Enclave]]: 
	- A bakery preserving the lost recipes of those who died to the [[Great Plague]] as wholesome. 
	- Bard circles narrating forbidden stories of esoteric or hazardous knowledge as versatile.
	- Puppet theaters used as propaganda for a tyrannical [[Civilization]] or for furthering agendas that incite political drama as dark.
- [[Domestication Enclave]]:
	- Petting zoos and sanctuaries of [[Pure Light]] [[Slimes]] that developed from the interaction with [[Pure Light]] beings and [[Agromagical Enclave]]s as wholesome.
	- War-beast stables with ethical treatment and selective breeding of the animals care as versatile.
	- Exploitative experimentation of creatures with the purpose of creating engineered destruction and submissive, loyal weapons as dark.
        

The tone is largely [[Civilization]] and narrative-choice driven, with no moral guidelines determining the impact or growth, and [[Enclave]]s gradually imprint [[Civilization]]-wide values, such as gratitude for food, humor as wisdom, ethical warfare, wisdom as communal, or coexistence with nature. Contrasting [[Enclave]]s values create tension while shared values [[Consonance]]. Providing texture and distinct identities of [[Civilization]] to [[Enclave]] and [[Enclave]] to [[Enclave]] relationships.

Likewise, some of the [[Enclave]]s serve to increase the contrast of dark and light in dark fantasy, this means that some will be goofy but meaningful. For example:

- **The [[Sprite-Light Conclave]]**: A [[Domestication Enclave]] of [[Pure Light]] [[Elemental Sprite]]s that developed coexistence with strange creatures preceding the slimes; they have a playful but deep history for the first [[Ages]].
    
- **The Singing Circle**: A [[Weaver Enclave]] reclaiming music as the essence of life against loss; simple joy as resistance to the [[Inevitability of Death]].
    
- **All-Welcome Cozy Inn**: An [[Indulgent Enclave]] that is a safe refuge for travelers, found family vibe. It was made by a band of orphaned children that grew up to believe everyone deserves a place to live, to travel, to enjoy life.
    
- **The Moonlit Gardens**: An [[Agromagical Enclave]] with [[Lunehymn]]-infused plants of grief turned into healing beauty. 
    
These provide wholesome, cozy stories within a dark world, raising overall emotional richness, and some also present the advancement and evolution of magic. The [[Sprite-Light Conclave]] is the explanation of how [[Elemental Sprite]]s came to shape as [[Slimes]] by the progressive development of [[Pure Light]] beings.

### [[Age Crisis]] as catalysts for [[Enclave]]s

[[Enclave]]s shine the most during [[Age Crisis]], as they're places that either enabled as a catalyst, as a response to an [[Age Crisis]] or as prevention for dampening the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]]. All [[Enclave]]s are born from an original wound, and several of the collective wounds come from the survivors of an [[Age Crisis]]. 

At the start of the game, there's almost no [[Enclave]]s, just separate tribal societies in the [[Age of Desolation]] struggling for survival. This leads to the development of the first [[Militant Enclave]] and [[Trading Enclave]]s, as survival mechanisms amongst the survivors of the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]]. When the [[Age Crisis]] of [[The Inescapable Hunger]] appears, it leads to terrible famines all across [[Arcanoria]], the survivors of the aftermath come to create [[Agromagical Enclave]]s as the [[Age of Renewal]] fully recaptures [[Spellweaving]] potency, and they adopt a mentality of "never again" to the famines. 

Some of these [[Enclave]]s further pursue this idea by transforming food into meaning, the [[Weaver Enclave]] or [[Indulgent Enclave]]s appear as a response of having luxuries and culture intertwined in food, like developing a bakery that isn't solely food, but meaning on the lost recipes as a mourning response to those who died during [[The Inescapable Hunger]]. This also presents dynamics where [[Agromagical Enclave]]s are helpful in developing the techniques for irrigation and growth that [[Weaver Enclave]] and [[Indulgent Enclave]]s use to then create their bread, crafting a dynamic structure of interdependency in logistics, trade, and giving a purpose to [[Trade Routes]] and [[Trade Nexus]], making the world "livable" and coexisting with [[Civilization]].

When other [[Age Crisis]] appear, [[Enclave]]s can still produce stories related to them. For example, in the [[Age of Renewal]] as magic becomes primordial it causes the [[Great Plague]] from exploitation. The vectors, the [[Luminant Moths]], are originally traded by [[Domestication Enclave]]s during the age. It's until midway of the [[Great Plague]] that [[Civilization]] realizes that they're the carriers of [[Luminant Decay]]. The [[Domestication Enclave]] was an enabler for the [[Age Crisis]], yet they can help in culling population, understanding the depth of the biological relationship and potentially give methods to prevent the catastrophic spiral.

Other types of [[Enclave]]s like [[Auric Enclave]]s can aid [[Domestication Enclave]]s with research, [[Faith]], and knowledge to work in tandem for a cure or to develop the magical waxed used by plague doctors to act as responses for the [[Dissonance bloom]]. Thus, the complex layer of interactions between [[Enclave]]s and [[Civilization]] enrich the world to the point that we have [[Auric Enclave]] explaining the [[Great Plague]]scientifically, and interprets its meaning theologically while [[Domestication Enclave]]s in tandem with [[Agromagical Enclave]]s provide the means of deterring, sanitizing, and controlling [[Luminant Moths]].

[[Industrious Enclave]]s will appear as alternatives to [[Pure Light]] streetlights by offering a safe, non-[[Luminant Moths]]-based light. It can help to reduce the infection rates too if invested in early enough. [[Age Crisis]] are a stress test of [[Arcanoria]]’s [[Civilization]]s horizontal infrastructure while providing narrative breadth and depth.

Finally, not all [[Enclave]]s will survive, which creates a tragedy on the application of limited resources maximizing player agency by choosing who are the survivors that will rebuild [[Civilization]] after the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]]. It makes also the previously goofy but meaningful [[Enclave]]s even more potent, because it creates dynamics where [[Civilization]] will try to save the [[Sprite-Light Conclave]] as they became attached to the [[Elemental Sprite]]s and the [[Slimes]], it is the light worth saving in a universe of encroaching dark fantasy.

[[Enclave]]s combine to answer: _What does [[Civilization]] value, and who are the survivors that will shape the next [[Ages]]?_
