Description: *The world has perfectly attuned!*

This is a special type of [[Seventh]] where [[Attunement for Magic]] is at its upmost peak. This happens due to the natural amount of [[Resonance]] in the world due to the [[Auric Heptacode]] in the [[Great Harmonic Loom]]. Some [[Events]] are unique only to the [[Ritual Seventh]].

Effects:
- Increase the potency of [[Magic Arts]] and [[Click Power]].
- Allow for unique [[Events]] to trigger.
