#age

*"Golden ashes forsaken by the Gods."

Description:
*"The once-great civilization is now reduced to a faraway memory, dwindled to dust, and scattered survivors struggling to find food, shelter, and safety. The land is littered with crumbling structures, decaying in remnants of a gentler past and steeped in a pervasive sense of despair. Only slim, isolated communities form as people strive to piece together their shattered lives, clinging to fragments of ancient knowledge and relics for hope."

The starting point of the [[Ages]] for the game, it pertains to Age 0 as it isn't itself a proper age but rather it is the result of the post apocalyptic landscape after a [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]].

Most of the magic in this age has been lost and there's only instinctive calling to elements to perform [[Minor Note]] basic sorcery, without the knowledge of [[The Principles of Magic]]. Likewise, Due to the [[Vibrational Fallout]] residual in the land, most of the [[Dual Confluence Stream]] is locked, and the low presence of both [[Lunehymn]] and [[Aetherlight]], it is very hard for magic to manifest except for some individuals with very strong [[Motif Awakening]]s, most of which are [[Resonance]] users due to the simplicity of [[Key of Attunement]].

[[Ornament]]s are completely unavailable in this age, and the only known rhythm tempo is staccato although most [[Spellweaver]]s are unaware of the presence of rhythmic elements for magic since it can only cover the very basic representation of elements in choral-like chants. 

The point of this era is to survive through the wasteland and find solace in fleeting communities. Most of the world became no man's land and all major empires, borders, and cultures are erased from history leaving only remnants behind. The gathering of magic elements usually comes in the shape of [[Old World Relics]] with sparse lookout towers sending explorers to the nearby areas.

The [[Age Crisis]] is [[The Inescapable Hunger]]. It's the result from the sudden growth of population reaching unsustainable growth levels given the conditions of the era and the lack of technologies to support through magic enhanced irrigation and harvesting systems. The core concept is to survive this first famine, it always leads to the [[Age of Renewal]] regardless of the success, the only difference between handling properly or poorly the famine is the amount of people surviving through it.
