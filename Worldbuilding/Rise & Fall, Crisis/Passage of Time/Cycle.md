Description: *A vow of fate. Each movement carries the world through creation, prosperity, chaos, and the final note of silent rebirth.*

They are the counterpart to Years and account for 252 [[Seventh]], with 12 of those being [[Ritual Seventh]], 12 [[Phase]] and 4 [[Echo]]. The structure of the time system is based on the Aztec Calendar and it is heavily built around the [[Auric Heptacode]] and the [[Trinity Harmony]]. It has repeating numerology patterns that thematically represent the [[Act of Fate]] and [[Resonance]] of the tuning of the world.

[[Cycle]] are an indefinite amount of lifetimes that happened over a period of time, thus they reflect the passage of [[Ages]] and are the building units of [[The Eternal Symphony]]. As if they were the musical pieces of an orchestral play. They all begin with a prelude and end in rebirth, with clear highs and falls of the environment and world's magic.

The full structure of a cycle in order is the following:

- [[Echo of Resonance]]
	- [[Phase of Prelude]]
	- [[Phase of Harmonics]]
	- [[Phase of Reflection]]
- [[Echo of Crescendo]]
	- [[Phase of Flourish]]
	- [[Phase of Zenith]]
	- [[Phase of Transition]]
- [[Echo of Dissonance]]
	- [[Phase of Discord]]
	- [[Phase of Ashfall]]
	- [[Phase of Fracture]]
- [[Echo of Silence]]
	- [[Phase of Stillness]]
	- [[Phase of Repose]]
	- [[Phase of Twilight]]

They repeat indefinitely, but a single [[Cycle]] takes 12.6 hours if it takes 3 minutes for a single [[Seventh]] to pass.
