Backbone for all of the [[Ages]] in [[Arcanoria]] from a high level standpoint. Each goes through several groups from Age 0 to 13, it represents the stage of societal, magical, scientifical, and technological development and it carries along some history until the next reset from a [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]].

All [[Ages]] have branching logic depending on the [[Age Crisis]] triggered from certain checks of resources, population, crisis technology, etc. Based on what the player has done during that age, their era score, the [[Age Crisis]] resolution, and certain focus missions, they will enter a [[Golden Age]], a [[Dark Age]] or a [[Standard Age]].

The diagram of all [[Ages]] is the following:

Excess [[Era Score]] above the required for a [[Golden Age]] becomes points that can redeem failed [[Age Crisis]] checks. Even if [[Civilization]] performs poorly during an [[Age Crisis]], it can be saved by the excess [[Era Score]] to go back into a [[Golden Age]] or resist a [[Dark Age]]. Additional [[Era Score]] is a saving grace buffer for [[Ages]] transitions.

The [[Age Crisis]] teaches that there's more than one [[Age Crisis]] possible, and the paths of [[World Event]]s have variation depending on the resolution. If the [[Civilization]] loses to [[Lacrimosa]] they become the "villain" as one of the satellites supporting [[The Hollowing]] during the [[Age of the False Messiah]].
