Description: *A piece of history in the breath of eternity.*

Echoes are the "seasons" of each [[Cycle]]. It is the [[Resonance]] of the world's fate made audible. As such, they have their unique environmental themes flowing within [[The Eternal Symphony]], and symbolizing a new [[Act of Fate]]. They are themed in Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter with each consisting of 3 [[Phase]], grouped thematically according to the attunement of the world.

A single [[Echo]] accounts for 63 [[Seventh]] with 8 normal and 3 [[Ritual Seventh]]. 6 and 3 of the 63 reflect the [[Trinity Harmony]]. All the [[Echo]] in the game are the following:

- [[Echo of Resonance]]
- [[Echo of Crescendo]]
- [[Echo of Dissonance]]
- [[Echo of Silence]]

Every effect of the [[Echo]] reflect in the Environment and greatly change modifiers.
