#spellweaving

*"Your wound is not your fault, but your healing is your responsibility - the difference between a Monster and a Hero is not the absence of pain, but the mastery of it."

The moment you receive a [[Soul Leitmotif]], the moment after hitting "rock-bottom" it is a deep personal moment of realization that awakens the magic of any [[Spellweaver]]. All magic starts unstable because these are awakened at the lowest but the [[Spellweaver]] must equally find the strength to weave both magic and resolve their personal conflicts. If the user awakes mid cast their [[Motif Awakening]]
it's likely to become a [[Catalytic Abyss of Emotion]].

*Akin to receiving a vision from Genshin*

A compilation of these [[Motif Awakening]]s can be found in:
