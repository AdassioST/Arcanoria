*"The universe was created on Seven Sacred Threads...  
But the demons are Eight-Born.  
And scholars dare not ask why."

![[Eight-Born Paths 1.png]]

The complete framework for demonological classification in Arcanoria, grounded in both psychological validity and metaphysical [[Coherence]]. Each path embodies a specific form of broken [[Consciousness]] — a shattered [[Fundamental Frequency]] born from the [[Auric Aria]]'s doubt during the [[Fifth Cycle]].

The [[Atonalis]] themselves embody and suffer from the psychological condition — they are not inflicting it externally but are the manifestation of that illness given predatory form and [[Consciousness]]. Thus, [[Atonalis]] do not cause these psychic fractures. They are the fractures of [[Consciousness]] itself. Each [[Atonalis]] is the crystallization of a broken harmonic state, suffering eternally in its own distortion. They are predatory only because their nature is hunger for the emotion that mirrors their wound, not because the wound is morally corrupt.

All of the mental disorders are a reference framework for distinction during design. The actual [[Atonalis]] are just named [[Anxithor]], [[Discant]], etc. No mention of mental illness only their reflection of behavior. It's up to the narrative to "label" if anything with mythological framing. This is only used in design documents for design purposes and for understanding within a framework the precise manifestation.

![[Eight-Born Paths.png]]

**Path I: [[Anxithor]] - The Perpetual Fear (16.00%)**

**Core Wound**: [[Consciousness]] trapped in eternal fear; hypervigilance becomes permanent state. The [[Atonalis]] cannot lower their guard. Splits reality into predator/prey categories constantly. Their mind never rests.

Included Disorders:
- Anxiety Disorders (8.80%)
- Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders (7.20%)

Feeds on: Fear, dread, anxious anticipation, paranoid certainty.

**Behavior:** Usually behaves by preemptive hostility, it is both protective of their territory yet paranoid; secludes and guards victims while feeding on their terror.

[[Primal Discordia]]: The Shrieking Sentinel.

**Path II: [[Discant]] - The Oscillating Affect (15.5%)**

**Core Wound**: [[Consciousness]] emotional frequency cannot stabilize; peaks and troughs without rhythm. The [[Atonalis]] experiences mood swings by distinct episodes of elevated moods and depression in a weaponized emotional state.

Included Disorders:
- Depressive Disorders (10.15%)
- Bipolar and Related Disorders (5.35%)

Feeds on: Emotional chaos, cascading mood disturbances, despair.

**Behavior:** Spreads despondency through communities like plague. Does not kill; corrupts. Poisons the harmonic frequencies of feeling itself.

[[Primal Discordia]]: The Discord Weaver. (Ying Yang)

**Path III: [[Obsessian]] - The Compulsive Prisoner (12.0%)**

**Core Wound**: Intrusive loops overwhelm [[Coherence]]. A single thought becomes an inescapable, eternal loop of [[Consciousness]]. The [[Atonalis]] is trapped in patterns they cannot break, compulsions they cannot resist, intrusive thoughts they cannot silence.

Included Disorders:
- Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (5.50%)
- Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders (6.50%)

Feeds on: Intrusive thoughts, obsessive cycles, forced repetition, recursive patterns.

**Behavior:** Creates zones of compulsive phenomena that can't distinguish reality. Forced loops — behavioral, mental, spiritual. Victims cannot distinguish their own thoughts from the demon's implantations.

[[Primal Discordia]]: The Looped Revenant.

**Path IV: [[Signath]] - The Shattered Reality (11.5%)**

**Core Wound**: [[Coherence]] cannot assemble; perception splinters across dimensions. The [[Atonalis]] cannot trust their senses. Reality becomes unreliable. Multiple contradictory truths exist simultaneously.

Included Disorders:
- Dissociative Disorders (6.40%)
- Neurocognitive Disorders (5.10%)

Feeds on: Reality distortion, perceptual confusion, erosion of epistemic certainty.

**Behavior:** Moves across multiple realities; contradicts observer perception. Understands three versions of truth simultaneously — all equally valid. Its attack is related to info hazards as it does not consume but rather dissolves certainty.

[[Primal Discordia]]: The Hollow Pilgrim.

**Path V: [[Carnalix]] - The Devouring Body (13.5%)**

**Core Wound**: Physical form wages war against [[Consciousness]]; systems betray themselves. The [[Atonalis]]' body becomes a hostile entity — reflecting physically, rejecting nourishment, failing in inexplicable ways.

Included Disorders:
- Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders (8.78%)
- Feeding and Eating Disorders (2.70%)
- Elimination Disorders (2.02%)

Feeds on: Physical suffering, bodily dysfunction, rejected nourishment.

**Behavior:** Spreads specific bodily rupture — this type of [[Atonalis]] targets decay and hostility based on their instinct and feeling reaction, it works primarily on strong emotions and cannot be satiated because satisfaction is contrary to its nature.

[[Primal Discordia]]: The Corpus Mortuum.

**Path VI: [[Animach]] - The Fractured Self (13.00%)**

**Core Wound**: Unified self cannot cause [[Coherence]]; no stable "I" persists across moments. The [[Atonalis]] becomes fractured — multiple selves competing, no central authority, identity constantly negotiable.

Included Disorders:
- Personality Disorders (6.50%)
- Neurodevelopmental Disorders (6.50%)

Feeds on: Identity fracture, conflicting self-concepts, loss of core self

**Behavior:** Each personality has competing goals; chaotic but effective consensus reached through internal conflict. These [[Atonalis]] often become functional through their fragmentation, leading to denial of the problem.

[[Primal Discordia]]: The Morpheus Abysmal.

**Path VII: [[Violux]] - The Corrupted Will (13.3%)**

**Core Wound**: Impulse severs from intention. Will becomes a runaway force acting against its own values. The [[Atonalis]]' will becomes weaponized in a destructive force where transgression becomes inevitable — both waking and sleeping, the [[Atonalis]] cannot escape their own selves.

Included Disorders:
- Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders (7.50%)
- Sleep-Wake Disorders (4.30%)
- Paraphilic Disorders - Enacted/Transgressive Manifestation (1.50%)

Feeds on: Transgression, loss of agency, the shame that follows unwanted acts.

**Behavior:** Methodical in pursuit; drives compulsive action not out of malice, but because it cannot stop its own momentum — its “will” is an uncontrolled harmonic recoil. Then feeds on guilt and shame. In sleep, the [[Atonalis]] enacts further transgressions through nightmare violence and terror episodes. May pursue a same victim for years. There is no escape into rest.

[[Primal Discordia]]: The Imperium Obsessus.

**Path VIII: [[Erosyx]] - The Lustful Denied (5.2%)**

**Core Wound**: Identity imposed contradicts internal truth in harm caused by external misassignment; distorted by outside expectation despite resistance. The [[Atonalis]] is forced to inhabit identity that wounds them, marked with false naming, sexuality and a reclused, deviant perversion.

Included Disorders:
- Gender Dysphoria (2.08%)
- Sexual Dysfunctions (1.30%)
- Paraphilic Disorders - Fantasy/Desire Manifestation (1.82%)

Feeds on: Identity denial, sexual dysfunction, intimacy twisted by fear and shame.

**Behavior:** Infiltrates human society; performs as a collapse of self through relational distortion in false identity until the revelation moment. Operates through seduction and intimacy rather than force, through affection and longing, creating bonds of love and desire in a fatal trap.

[[Primal Discordia]]: The Wrongly Named.
