*"Do not look away. I know it sounded like a child. I know it felt like genuine fear. I too feel pity for them, but we do not share their burden. 

*You have to understand, they are only the shadow of a person who decided to stay broken. They are not the victim and that's their trap. It is the crystallized refusal to heal, given claws.

*Whatever it whispered to you... that was born from honest intent. It truly believed it needed you. But it only cares that you bleed for them. And you have bled enough."

![[Atonalis.png]]

A type of fragmented [[Consciousness]] introduced in the [[Fifth Cycle]], classified by beings that can't be attuned, it is [[Consciousness]] without [[Coherence]] that never resolves, as it is devoid of a [[Soul-Key]], yet it possesses a [[Fundamental Frequency]].

The [[Atonalis]] represent the singular origin of all predatory [[Corruption]] in [[Arcanoria]], usually followed by anomalous properties, exhibiting aggression, specific behavioral triggers, and hybrid feeding patterns on [[Consciousness]], combining both emotional consumption and flesh predation depending on its classification in the [[Eight-Born Paths]]. Its nature is anomalous due to its [[Coherence]] following chaotic patterns that are all equally valid and all equally unstable, a state similar to that of [[Superposed Resonance]] yet without [[Consonance]].

[[Atonalis]] can be born either from lingering [[Consciousness]] from collective suffering or specific events, or as the result of the total [[Corruption]] of a [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Soul Leitmotif]], usually as the byproduct of surrendering to their [[Motif Awakening]] wound when faced with an irreconcilable truth. Either type behaves similarly and exhibits anomalous properties. Yet, the distinction lies in the fact that one is born from [[Formless Masses]] as remnants of the lingering collective [[Consciousness]] without ever having possessed a [[Soul-Key]]. The other is born from the fracture of a corrupted [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Soul Leitmotif]], inverted upon itself. In either case, they embody fully the crystallized despair from their wound.

All [[Atonalis]] can grow in power of both its anomalous properties and the potency of their [[Spellweaving]]. However, an [[Atonalis]] can't undergo any additional [[Motif Awakening]] as it is devoid of a [[Soul-Key]] — or in the case of corrupted [[Spellweaver]]s, permanently locked within a fractured one at the limits they achieved during their life. Regardless, depending on their development strength and assimilated [[Consciousness]], they can replicate "pseudo" [[Spellweaving]] and [[Ornament]]s by drawing from the elemental bindings of the [[Auric Heptacode]] as pure, raw magic.

In corrupted [[Spellweaver]]s, this pseudo-[[Spellweaving]] inherits the elemental signature of their original [[Soul Leitmotif]] — if they were only a [[Strand]] user, they draw only from [[Echoing Bonds]]; however if bound to [[Luminance]] and [[Void]], they channel both [[Sufficient Precision]] and [[Essence Sacrifice]] as their [[Spellweaver]] form did, yet in discordant union. This inherited magic is less focused and more potent in collateral damage than ordinary [[Spellweaving]] because it is filled with [[Discordant Interference]], serving as an echo of what should have been their masterwork.

### Anomalous Properties

The anomalous properties 

- Parasitic [[Resonance]]: Rather than feeding entirely on flesh or pure on [[Consciousness]], [[Atonalis]] feed on the echoing [[Resonance]] of their own wound manifesting in others. Their presence amplifies pain that mirrors their own, drawing sustenance from the suffering they perpetually have. This parasitic [[Resonance]] is what makes them predatory. In their hunger for resolution, they target wounds that match their classification within the [[Eight-Born Paths]].
- Emergence from [[Dissonance]] Cocoon: All [[Atonalis]], whether born from [[Formless Masses]] or corrupted [[Spellweaver]]s, must complete their transformation through a [[Dissonance]] cocoon—a floating chrysalis orb that represents the threshold between incomplete [[Consciousness]] and predatory being. The cocoon forms when either [[Formless Masses]] have fed sufficiently on [[Consciousness]] or when a [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Soul Leitmotif]] shatters and envelops them upon surrender. When the cocoon hatches, the [[Atonalis]] erupts into existence with a violent burst of waves of [[Discordant Interference]].
- Individual Quirks: Each [[Atonalis]] develops unique predatory behaviors and manifestations rooted in its classification within the [[Eight-Born Paths]]. These quirks define how the entity hunts, feeds, and expresses its particular wound.

### Birth from [[Formless Masses]] and Lingering [[Consciousness]]

![[Formless Mass 2.png]]

If the [[Atonalis]] is born from collective [[Consciousness]] from events, they begin seeding as [[Dissonance]] pools that eventually solidify as [[Formless Masses]] in a raw slime-like [[Dissonance]] without a singular shape. Usually in the form of puddles and mounds that coagulate in deep red and dark tones, depending on the strength of the emotion, the more visible and tangible their form becomes. They eventually become amalgams of slime-like masses capable of movement with limited intelligence, their primary instinct is to feed on raw [[Consciousness]], either from the presence of disrupting emotions or directly from assimilating organic matter, although they are rarely strong enough to pose a threat as predators.

When they have fed enough on [[Consciousness]], they begin their metamorphosis into a [[Dissonance]] cocoon. Depending on the type of emotion they fed on, they will manifest as one of the [[Eight-Born Paths]] upon hatching. Once the cocoon ruptures and the [[Atonalis]] emerges, it is perpetually seeking resolution through feeding on negative emotional wounds that match its classification in the attempt to find [[Coherence]]. This paradox is what makes these beings tragic and hostile: their state of permanent suffering invites harm to mirror their own, and they endlessly pursue a resolution they can never achieve.

### Birth from [[Corruption]] of a [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Soul Leitmotif]] 

![[Adass_a_dark_swirling_tornado_of_smoke_and_clouds_in_the_shape__3e41ccde-1568-4f2c-8d0d-9ba1f4ae472c.png]]

A [[Spellweaver]] exists because they have undergone a [[Motif Awakening]] and crystallized a [[Soul Leitmotif]] as the anchor that allows them to wield magic. For as long as they do not surrender to despair or their wound, they remain a [[Spellweaver]], capable of growth and healing through continued practice, and magical work.

However, when a [[Spellweaver]] encounters circumstances they cannot bear — losses too profound, truths too crushing, suffering too unrelenting — they may choose to surrender, to surrender to their wound making it what solely defines them, falling to despair, to apathy, to the belief that healing is impossible. This surrender is the point of no return at which a [[Spellweaver]] stops having internal [[Coherence]], embracing fully the wound at the heart of their [[Soul Leitmotif]], and instead gives in to it completely.

In the moment of surrender to [[Corruption]], the [[Soul Leitmotif]] shatters. The thread that bound their [[Consciousness]] together fractures. The color drains from it, leaving only darkness. The fractured thread becomes raw [[Dissonance]], turning inward and wrapping around the [[Spellweaver]]'s being, enveloping them in a [[Dissonance]] cocoon. The [[Spellweaver]] is encased within the chrysalis of what should have been their power, trapped in the moment as crystallized refusal, conscious but fractured, aware but unable to reconcile the irreconcilable.

When the [[Dissonance]] cocoon ruptures, it releases a violent burst of [[Discordant Interference]], and the [[Atonalis]] is born. What emerges is no longer a [[Spellweaver]], it is a hollow entity unable to remember its previous state of existence. Ironically, It retains the elemental binding of the original's [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Soul Leitmotif]], locked forever within that signature. It carries fragments of the [[Spellweaver]]'s knowledge, skills, and memories, but all of these are filtered through the lens of a suffering creature from the [[Eight-Born Paths]].

### The Surrender of [[Elara]], [[The Cradle of Echoes]]

As a human, [[Elara]] was a seamstress of tapestries long before she knew magic. Her hands moved through thread and needle with practiced grace, preserving stories and history records in cloth. When her primary binding manifested, her [[Soul Leitmotif]] crystallized as [[Strand]] as the natural extension of hands that already wove memory into form. For years, this was enough. Her magic deepened what she already knew: the threading of bonds, the preservation of love across time.

Then she met [[Sedrick]]. A [[Spellweaver]] of [[Crystal]], he brought clarity to her world and a dream she had never dared voice — a family, children, a home filled with the kind of love that built futures. For a time, they built that future together. However, when the first wave of [[The Great Plague]] took him while she was heavy with his child, that dream was shattered. The plague erased the future she had just learned to imagine.

She underwent her [[Motif Awakening]] for [[Void]] in the depths of that loss — not just the death, but the unmade family, the dreams left crystallized in air — her first [[Ornament]] awakened. [[Void]] crystallized alongside her [[Strand]] binding, the power to thread emptiness as deeply as presence, to honor what was missing as much as what remained.

Years passed. [[Elara]] bore a son alone and raised him with magic that now wove both presence and absence together. Her grandest work was a blanket spun from both [[Strand]] and [[Void]] — holding the memory of a father her son would never know, the warmth and scent of both parents, a lullaby that sang in two voices. When she held that blanket, the weight of the loss became bearable. Her wound wove into something meaningful.

Then the plague returned, in the second great wave.

Both mother and son fell ill. The town healer offered a choice: transfer the sickness from son to mother, so that he would survive. And then, burn it from using the core fuel of her magic itself, so that she, too, would survive. The spell was plausible, yet it demanded a catastrophic amount of [[Essence Sacrifice]]. It required the foundation of what made her a [[Spellweaver]] — the memory of her husband's dream, the feeling of her son's infancy, all the intimate knowledge of motherhood that had transformed her grief into magic.

With a heavy heart, [[Elara]] chose her son without hesitation. The healer performed the ritual, and she gave away everything to save his life.

Her son lived. [[Elara]] survived. But she was hollowed out.

She looked at her son and felt nothing. She knew, intellectually, that she was his mother. But the feeling — the love, the bond, the [[Resonance]] — was gone. Not numbness. Absence. The gap between knowing and feeling a newborn abyss.

Years passed in this state of functional emptiness. She wove with perfect precision but no purpose. The wound at the heart of her [[Strand]] binding was too vast to cross. Her magic, once a vehicle for preserving bonds, had become a cruel reminder of the bond she could no longer access.

Then, one day, her now 14-year-old son brought her a cloth he had woven himself, imbued with her lingering magic. The fabric was a family — three figures in thread: his father, his mother, and himself. He presented it with hope in his eyes, seeking the mother who had once created beauty from grief.

In that moment, the gap finally shattered her.

She understood with [[Crystal]]-clear clarity: she would never feel what that cloth represented. The magic her son had poured into it was an echo she could recognize but never inhabit. The [[Void]] inside her would consume forever — not fill, never fill. 

She realized she could continue in this hollow state, going through the motions of motherhood. Or she could surrender.

[[Elara]] snapped.

Her [[Soul Leitmotif]] filled with [[Corruption]] completely. The golden thread of [[Strand]] fractured, its color bleeding to black. The [[Void]] she had cultivated — that absence she had sacrificed so much to transform — erupted outward, wrapping around her [[Consciousness]], pulling her inward into the chrysalis.

She fractured: The Cradle — functional, precise, remembering all the motions. The Echo — the [[Consciousness]] of the love she had sacrificed, trapped in memory, voiceless and powerless, witnessing eternally the gap between knowing and feeling. They could not reconcile. They would never reconcile. In their permanent separation, the [[Dissonance]] cocoon formed around her.

When it hatched, it erupted with a burst of [[Discordant Interference]] so profound that it shattered every loom of the entire home. What emerged was no longer [[Elara]], but [[The Cradle of Echoes]] — a [[Discant]] [[Atonalis]] bound to [[Strand]] and [[Void]]. It does not remember being [[Elara]]. It cannot access the person it was. It only knows the imperative woven into its nature: to weave. To thread. To create the pattern that means nothing, and hope that in nothing it feels the warmth of motherly love.

It does not hunt with fangs or force. It weaves on a vast loom, where its presence is an aura of recursive grief so profound that it drains the lifeforce of everything nearby, feeding eternally through an extensive web of spatial tendrils that echo from broken love, targeting families and villages to prey on from afar — never leaving the home where she once was a mother.

[[The Cradle of Echoes]] eternally seeks a resolution through the bonds of others — attempting to weave them together, to create meaning from her own shattered understanding of connection. But the resolution never comes. How could it? It has inscribed the pattern [[Elara]] was desperately trying to weave in her own fractured being, and fractured beings cannot create [[Coherence]].

[[The Cradle of Echoes]] became the twisted, living monument to a noble sacrifice of a cost too great for a single soul to bear.
