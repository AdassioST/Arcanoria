Lingering collapsed [[Consciousness]] and existence, they are the first and base state of [[Atonalis]]. Depending on the environment they feed of, they will become a demon based on any of the [[Eight-Born Paths]].

Mental illnesses materialized as an embodiment of [[Dissonance]], the opposite of a [[Perfect Manifestation of Life]].

The original [[Formless Masses]] came to be the [[Primal Discordia]].
