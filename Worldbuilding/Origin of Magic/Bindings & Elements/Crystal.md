*[[Consciousness]] is the fabric of reality, matter is nothing more than crystalized vibration.*

[[Crystal]] is the element of crystalized reality, of [[Consciousness]] given form in the physical world as an ordered structure, it is the element bound to [[Absolute Certainty]] in [[The Principles of Magic]]. [[Crystal]] structures are repeating patterns of fractals that can be enhanced with properties of complex [[Spellweaving]]. This is the core for giving shape to thoughts as as an unbreakable will. 

The strength of these structures depends on the ability of the [[Spellweaver]] to imagine them as durable and the mental conviction of it holding true. Despite crystals being commonly rigid structures, they can attain flexible properties akin to nanomaterials and highly complex polymers through the combination of other elemental properties such as [[Flux]] and [[Void]].
