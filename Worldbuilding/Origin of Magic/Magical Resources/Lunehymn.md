A pale silvery liquid reflecting the echoing moonlit ocean that mirrored the heavens in the founding scene [[The Silent Expanse]]. It is paired with [[Aetherlight]] in the [[Dual Confluence Stream]], reflecting the relationship between [[Selenea]] and the [[Auric Aria]] as creators of [[Arcanoria]].

In small volume, [[Lunehymn]] presents as a pale, glassy silver with faint, synchronized glimmers. If concentrated, the pale oil shifts to a deep, moon‑ocean blue suffused with star‑like cosmic motes. Its surface often seems preternaturally calm, with micro‑ripples that respond to sound rather than touch.
