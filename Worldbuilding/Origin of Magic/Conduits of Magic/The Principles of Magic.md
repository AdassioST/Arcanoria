*[[Resonance]]. [[Luminance]], [[Flux]], [[Void]], [[Cindergale]], [[Crystal]], [[Strand]]

Magic in [[Arcanoria]] flows through seven foundational principles, each bound to a virtue and a constraint, drawing directly from one of the golden threads in the [[Auric Heptacode]]. The principles are divided into the seven bindings of [[Spellweaving]] and cast upon the various layers of [[Consciousness]] from [[The First Overtone]], and from these layers, the principles create physicality in the [[Known Universe]].

In [[Arcanoria]], they greatly amplify the magical [[Resonance]] of [[Frequency Harmonics]] due to the existence of the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] using a [[Soul Leitmotif]] with [[Music as Catalyst]]. The bindings themselves are equal to masterfully playing a song:

- You find your note (1). [[Key of Attunement]].
- You play a precise interval (2).  [[Sufficient Precision]].
- You imbue it with feeling (3).  [[Emotional Authenticity]].
- You understand the strength required to apply dynamics and play it. [[Essence Sacrifice]].
- You sustain it with focus (5). [[Perfect Focus]].
- You resolve it with perfect certainty (6). [[Absolute Certainty]].
- You harmonize it with other players (7). [[Echoing Bonds]].

The expertise combination of [[Sufficient Precision]], [[Perfect Focus]], and [[Absolute Certainty]] is called [[Mastery Over Chaos]]. While [[Emotional Authenticity]], [[Essence Sacrifice]], and [[Echoing Bonds]] create the [[Potential of Creation]].

### The Seven Bindings

Woven from the [[Auric Heptacode]], these seven bindings form the invisible rules for [[Spellweaving]] upon which they govern every [[Spellweaver]]'s spell integrity, cost, and potency. Each binding names a core psychological and physical domain, and anchors a facet of [[Consciousness]] to an elemental aspect keyed uniquely to the [[Spellweaver]]'s soul.

Every single person is naturally aligned to a binding once they trigger a [[Motif Awakening]] and, while the proficiency in said element is given by nature, authentic [[Spellweaving]] demands walking the delicate edge between fused elements. Thus, it is possible to create combinations of two or more bindings, and it's an essential practice of advanced [[Spellweaving]]. Still, it is a carefully crafted dance of profound mastery, personal growth, and binding knowledge, as fusions of several elements are more challenging to sustain without diluting direction and potency.

The seven bindings, its core, constrain, personal root, [[Motif Awakening]], and attuned elements are as follows:

#### [[Key of Attunement]] — Purpose, Identity and Self-Integrity

*First Auric Thread of Wave Mechanics.*
Attuned Element [[Resonance]]. (Sound + Wind)

The art of harmony begins in serenity — when the self grows quiet enough to hear the world's song, and whole again to hold its own voice.

**Constraint:** The [[Spellweaver]]’s intent must align with their [[Fundamental Frequency]] soul-key. Potency is amplified by unwavering purpose and dampened by inner conflict.

**Personal Root & [[Motif Awakening]]:** Seeking belonging after isolation / Finding your place in the world. Those "Out of tune" who learn to align their soul-key to the world.

*"A string only rings true when perfectly tuned to the purpose of a key."*

#### [[Sufficient Precision]] - Mental Clarity, Truth and Intent 

*Second Auric Thread of Information Theory*
Attuned Element [[Luminance]]. (Light + Lightning)

To weave a flawless thread is to strike a note pure, clean, and uncaught with stray threads — each arc of energy a single note, sharp enough as a blinding truth.

**Constraint:** A spell must weave a single magical thread, a single defined purpose and effect; An articulation with poor clarity causes [[Dissonance]]. Potency is amplified by a precise definition of the spell, and it is dampened by ambiguity or generalist behavior.

**Personal Root & [[Motif Awakening]]:** Needing clarity after deception or confusion. Those betrayed by lies or who suffered catastrophic consequences due to ignorance who now demand the piercing truth.

*"A note only sounds pure when struck cleanly."

#### [[Emotional Authenticity]] - Emotional Truth and Vulnerability

*Third Auric Thread of Thermodynamics*
Attuned Element [[Flux]]. (Water + Currents)

To touch the fabric of reality, one must be true to the wellspring of feeling within. Emotion flows like water and wind — unseen yet shaping all that breathes. Magic is born from honest expression.

**Constraint:** Strength and nature of a spell rise with the profundity and clarity of the [[Spellweaver]]'s genuine feelings. Potency is amplified by the depth of an emotion felt, its meaning, and enhances the boundaries of manifestation depending on the truthfulness of embracing that emotional discharge. Dampened by an unclear emotional state and a forced or hollow feeling.

**Personal Root & [[Motif Awakening]]:** Embracing vulnerability after prolonged emotional suppression. Those who stop hiding or finally understand their feelings and let their emotions flow.

*"An expression only carries feeling when born of honest intent".

#### [[Essence Sacrifice]] - Self-Worth, Loss and Commitment

*Fourth thread: Auric Thread of Conservation of Energy.*
Attuned Element [[Void]]. (Shadow + Space)

Spellcraft is a currency of what one holds dearest. Power flows only when the [[Spellweaver]] parts with a fragment of their [[Fundamental Frequency]], [[Consciousness]], and being — the [[Spellweaver]]'s own shards of memory, life force, physical exhaustion, or symbolic attachments are the fuel of magic. Every enchantment mirrors the sacrifice, birth, and creation based on [[Perfect Reflection]].

**Constraint:** A meaningful fragment of the [[Spellweaver]] is consumed on spell creation. Potency is amplified by alignment with the spell's theme and dampened by superficial offerings. Not all spells demand heavy sacrifice, but all can be greatly empowered by it.

**Personal Root & [[Motif Awakening]]:** Accepting a profound loss after attachment. Those who learn that true power comes from letting go, that they have their own value.

*"Masterful dynamics require strength, and it has a cost both physically and mentally for the performer."*

#### [[Perfect Focus]] - Present Awareness, Passion, and Flow State

*Fifth Auric Thread of Inertia and Momentum*
Attuned Element [[Cindergale]]. (Fire + Wind)

Fire is the breath that keeps the notes alive, wind is the unseen flow that holds the song aloft. It requires passion and unyielding attention to fully channel the essence of your [[Consciousness]] into something for it to come true. It taps into the flow state and can be heavily enhanced if the [[Spellweaver]] can remain concentrated in an undisturbed flow, even within the eye of chaos in a storm.

**Constraint:** Casting demands uninterrupted flow-state until completion. Layered and over time spells require more mental action than instant casting, but an unwavering state of perfect spell weaving is a blazing arc nigh impossible to defeat. Potency is amplified in silence, ritual, or during a state of flow, such as battle, and dampened by distraction.

**Personal Root & [[Motif Awakening]]:** Finding direction after being lost and scattered. Those who channel scattered energy into a singular, passionate, unwavering burst.

*"Harmonics' full potential only sustains in undisrupted, unwavering performance."

#### [[Absolute Certainty]] - Vision, Imagination and Conviction

*Sixth Auric Thread of Quantum Collapse*
Attuned Element [[Crystal]]. (Earth + Prisms)

Nothing steps into existence without first taking shape within the mind's eye. A vision unseen cannot bloom. Only if it can be visualized can it exist. What you can't imagine happening cannot come to be.

**Constraint:** Casting spells requires a complete mental forging, a vivid rehearsal beneath the effects of existence. It taps into the innate [[Potential of Creation]] of [[Consciousness]] and requires deep belief and confidence. A spell has to be directly tied to the self-perceived [[Coherence]]. Potency is amplified by vivid visualization and will. Dampened by doubt, overthinking, and insecurity in becoming real.

**Personal Root & [[Motif Awakening]]:** Forging their own will and vision after chaos and doubt. Those paralyzed by uncertainty who created their own unbreakable conviction.

*"A melody only soars when known where to resolve before playing the first note."

#### [[Echoing Bonds]] - Temporal Continuity, Memory and Loyalty.

*Seventh Auric Thread of Relativity*
Attuned Element [[Strand]]. (Time + Memory)

Magic is not only forged in the moment but woven with weight through the [[Ages]]. The strength of a bond — its history, its memory — casts a temporal echo across the fabric of fate. The strength of the bond between [[Spellweaver]] and target signifies the importance of the story and the role of fate. This binding is the only one to utilize the one golden strand of the [[Auric Heptacode]] that interacts with the [[Trinity Harmony]], thereby granting access to both spatial and temporal properties rooted in personal legacy.

**Constraint:** Bond quality, depth, and duration are the anchor that determines spell tier and resistance to disruption. A spell potency is amplified by longstanding loyalty and memory, while dampened by betrayal, denial of the past, amnesia, or neglect.

**Personal Root & [[Motif Awakening]]:** Honoring legacy after betrayal, dishonor, broken trust, or in healing a scarred, broken past. Those who rebuild trust over time and mend past, present, and future.

*"A leitmotif by itself is simple, but when it carries weight and history, it is masterful."*

### [[Spellweaving]] and Advanced Magic

Every binding in Arcanoria may be struck as a [[Minor Note]] or a [[Major Note]], each reflecting a different depth of commitment and consequence. [[Minor Note]]s draw upon fleeting emotions and lighter expressions of elemental power; they are most suitable for simple charms but most commonly used in supportive enhancement effects. [[Major Note]]s channel core convictions, and are usually the Root of any solid magic. They are heavily influenced by the casted attuned element.

Though [[Minor Note]] spells cost little, usually only slight fatigue, even the most trivial enchantment can ascend to a [[Major Note]] when fueled by a meaningful [[Essence Sacrifice]]. Finally, the true artistry of [[The Principles of Magic]] lies in weaving multiple bindings together into a single composition. Spell craft can only hold one [[Major Note]] and it unfolds like a song, with three essential components that create any spell:

- **Melody**: The fundamental essence of a spell — a single binding cast as a [[Major Note]] that defines the enchantment's elemental theme and emotional direction. Whether it sings with purpose, blazes with focus, or glints with crystalline vision, the Root sets the spell's identity.

- **Rhythm**: Tempo governs the spell’s flow, with [[Perfect Focus]] keeping time as conductor. Spells pulse and release in five core patterns:

	- **Staccato:** Sharp, punctured bursts. (Instant effects, Rapid-fire attacks)
	- **Legato:** Smooth, continuous flow. (Sustained, Ongoing barriers)
	- **Accelerando:** Gradual acceleration for surging power. (Spell barrages)
	- **Ritardando:** Gentle slowdown for controlled release. (Fading effects)
	- **Polyrhythm:** Interleaved bursts and lulls. (Chaotic spells)
	
- **Harmony**:  Harmony adds color by layering up to three additional bindings as [[Minor Note]]s, crafting musical intervals that enrich and complicate the spell. A third interval brings warmth or precision, a fifth reinforces strength, and a seventh introduces dramatic tension that must resolve. Harmonic complexity is the basis of all advanced [[Spellweaving]], as these components intertwine into the four chord spell tiers:
  
	- **[[Unison]] Spells (Root Only):** Pure elemental magic with a single [[Major Note]]. Unisons create reliable, straightforward effects with minimum cost. It is the most common and basic magic.
	- **[[Dyad Chord]] Spells (Root + Third):** Advanced magic adding one [[Minor Note]] at the third interval. Dyads refine the Root imbuing properties of depth or specialized function while maintaining spell stability.
	- **[[Triad Chord]] Spells (Root + Third + Fifth):** The most common chord, expert-level magic combining three bindings in consonant harmony. These create powerful, balanced effects through the interplay of the [[Major Note]] Root, the third [[Minor Note]], and the fifth [[Minor Note]].
	- **[[Tetrad Chord]] Spells (Root + Third + Fifth + Seventh):** Master-level impossible compositions weaving four bindings into a reality bending tense chord of a [[Major Note]] and three [[Minor Note]]s. To cast, they demand profound sacrifice and require perfect focus and precise resolution to prevent catastrophic [[Dissonance]].

As complexity grows, so does unpredictability, demanding ever-greater [[Absolute Certainty]] to guide each chord through chaos into harmony. The interplay of [[Major Note]]s and [[Minor Note]]s, varied tempos, and intervallic richness yields near-infinite spell variations, with creativity being the sole limitation.

Consequently, all basic [[Spellweaving]] can turn into advanced, expert, or reality-bending spells so long as there is sufficient mastery over the seven bindings and a [[Essence Sacrifice]] fuel potent enough to sustain it. The discovery and widespread application of chords depend on the [[Ages]] of [[Spellweaving]] and the discovery of the society's own magical research.

### Examples of Spell Crafting

- **Igniting Cooking Pot (Minor [[Unison]])**

Root: [[Cindergale]], [[Minor Note]] - A small spark.
Harmony: No other bindings.
Tempo: Staccato

**Effect:** An instant spark that is good for starting the fire of a field kitchen.

- **Lightning Disk ([[Unison]])**

Root: [[Luminance]]. [[Major Note]] - A focused arc of energy.
Harmony: No other bindings.
Tempo: Accelerando

**Effect:** A lightning disk that becomes bigger and stronger the more time it is cast.

- **Ember Rain ([[Dyad Chord]])**  

Root: [[Cindergale]], [[Major Note]] - A focused column of fire-wind.
Harmony: [[Flux]], [[Minor Note]], Third - Raw emotion fuels the flame.
Tempo: Staccato

**Effect:** Piercing fire whirl darts that burn with the [[Spellweaver]]'s passionate intensity.

- **Prismatic Spray ([[Triad Chord]])**

Root: [[Flux]], [[Major Note]] - A flowing spray of liquid with a strong caudal.
Harmony: [[Crystal]], [[Minor Note]], Third + [[Luminance]], [[Minor Note]], Fifth)
Tempo: Legato

**Effect:** A prismatic rainbow-like spray that, on contact, creates pyramids of crystals. These structures then emit resonating light that interacts with each other, bouncing in waves between them and amplifying the spell's light the more crystals there are.

- **Memory Weaving Field ([[Tetrad Chord]])**

Root: [[Strand]], [[Major Note]] - Several time strings with deep ancestral connection.  
Harmony: [[Flux]], [[Minor Note]], Third + [[Void]], [[Minor Note]], Fifth + [[Resonance]], [[Minor Note]], Seventh.
Tempo: Polyrhythm

**Effect:** An immense field of sporadic chaotic waves that reconstruct lost memories and recreate visions of the state of the land in the past. However, some of the chaotic waves cause immediate amnesia. Casting this spell would require a heavy [[Essence Sacrifice]] for fuel and require mastery of [[Sufficient Precision]] to avoid psychological fragmentation.

### Elemental Harmonic Circle

Regardless of complexity, all elemental representations of attuned elements from each of the seven bindings interact with each other based on the [[Major Note]] of the spell. This happens on the principle of the Pentatonic Effectiveness Circle ([[Flux]], [[Cindergale]], [[Crystal]], [[Resonance]], [[Strand]]) and the Dance of Light and Shadow that are effective and weak to one another (Luminance vs Void).

The interactions are as follows:

**Pentatonic Effectiveness Circle:**

**[[Flux]] ▶ [[Cindergale]] ▶ [[Crystal]] ▶ [[Resonance]] ▶ [[Strand]] ▶ back to [[Flux]]

1. **[[Flux]] (Water + Wind) ▶ [[Perfect Focus]] ([[Cindergale]])**
    
    - Thematic: Unrestrained emotion sweeps away scattered thoughts, demanding renewed concentration.
        
    - Physical: Flowing water and gusting winds extinguish and disperse flickering embers.
        
    - Psychological: Honest feelings interrupt tunnel vision, forcing the mind to realign priorities.
        
2. **[[Perfect Focus]] ([[Cindergale]]: Fire + Wind) ▶ [[Absolute Certainty]] ([[Crystal]])**
    
    - Thematic: Sustained, directed will forges vague ideas into solid conviction.
        
    - Physical: Heat and wind reshape ore into precise crystalline facets.
        
    - Psychological: Undisturbed attention crystallizes beliefs, turning potential into unshakeable truth.
        
3. **[[Absolute Certainty]] ([[Crystal]]: Earth + Prism) ▶ [[Key of Attunement]] ([[Resonance]])**
    
    - Thematic: Rock-hard conviction emits a pure tone that realigns one's core purpose.
        
    - Physical: Faceted crystals act as both a trap and sonic resonators, amplifying and ensnaring even whispered intention.
        
    - Psychological: Firm beliefs "ring true" in the self, tuning the soul to its fundamental frequency.
        
4. **[[Key of Attunement]] ([[Resonance]]: Sound + Air) ▶ [[Echoing Bonds]] ([[Strand]])**
    
    - Thematic: A harmonized self deepens and preserves relationships across time.
        
    - Physical: Sound waves travel through resonant mediums, carrying echoes and memories, and making strings vibrate harder.
        
    - Psychological: Clear purpose strengthens loyalty and trust, weaving shared history into living bonds.
        
5. **[[Echoing Bonds]] ([[Strand]]: Time + Memory) ▶ [[Flux]]**
    
    - Thematic: Secure, longstanding ties allow genuine feelings to flow freely again.
        
    - Physical: Releasing temporal stasis, like a dam break, unleashes powerful currents.
        
    - Psychological: Trust and safety in relationships unlock emotional authenticity, completing the cycle.
        

**Dance of Light and Shadow**

[[Luminance]] and [[Void]] are at a timeless dance outside of the pentatonic effectiveness circle, but are rather intertwined with each other

- **[[Luminance]] (Light + Lightning)**
    
    - Effective to [[Void]]: Clarity dispels emptiness.
        
    - Weakness to [[Void]]: Nihilism swallows insight.
        
- **[[Void]] (Shadow + Space)**
    
    - Effective to [[Luminance]]: Emptiness consumes illumination.
        
    - Weakness to [[Luminance]]: True understanding shatters meaninglessness.
