#spellweaving

A popular statement and magic principle which defines the seven bindings of the [[Auric Heptacode]]. It is used to define the perfect spell weaver by having mastery in three primary categories: [[Mastery Over Chaos]], [[Potential of Creation]], and [[Key of Attunement]]. It's one of the core virtues that [[Perfect Reflection]] sought after.
