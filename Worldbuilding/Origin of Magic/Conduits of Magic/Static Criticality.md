_The principle that allows for Magical Nukes to exist_

A state of uncontrolled, unstable magic that arises when opposing currents or raw divine power exceed [[Harmonic Equilibrium]] — whether in the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] or the [[Dual Confluence Stream]]. In the Loom, [[Static Criticality]] shatters [[Coherence]] across countless threads; in the [[Dual Confluence Stream]], it erupts when [[Lunehymn]] and [[Aetherlight]] imbalance reaches a self-sustaining tipping point.

As for beings beyond the [[Known Universe]], [[Outer God]]s avoid [[Static Criticality]] by assuming an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]], which constrains their divine [[Resonance]] into a stable vessel. No divinity, neither [[Outer God]]s nor the [[Auric Aria]] can intervene directly without an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]].

The first encounter with [[Static Criticality]] happens in [[Ages]] I [[Age Crisis]] with the [[Great Plague]].

### The Mechanics of [[Coherence Detonation]]

When the saturation of the [[Dual Confluence Stream]] exceeds 50-70% imbalance, the local environment effectively becomes a pressurized vessel of volatile energy. The air itself is thick with unformed potential, straining against the threads of the [[Great Harmonic Loom]]. The missing pressure difference is the density of [[Aetherlight]] / [[Lunehymn]] particles forcing themselves against the [[Vibrational Density]].

The catastrophic results of [[Static Criticality]] imbalances can be understood as a rupture in the magical atmosphere caused by the pressure difference between a high-saturation environment and the low-[[Coherence]] pockets. This creates a volatile magical atmosphere seeking a discharge path, the result are localized cascading explosions due to the catastrophic equalization of this pressure.

This mechanism explains why the explosions are described as "cascades." One explosion releases raw [[Aetherlight]] ([[Emberwhisper]] particles) into the atmosphere, further increasing the local [[Dual Confluence Stream]] saturation (pressure) and creates a domino effect where one [[Coherence Detonation]] triggers adjacent pockets of instability, leading to the vaporization of large areas varying in strength due to the net pressure difference.

Ruptured threads with enough potency are able to create [[Vibrational Fallout]] and feed [[Primal White Noise]].
