#chaos #technology

A state of uncontrolled, unstable magic that arises when opposing currents or raw divine power exceed [[Harmonic Equilibrium]] — whether in the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] or the [[Dual Confluence Stream]]. In the Loom, Static Criticality shatters [[Coherence]] across countless threads; in the Stream, it erupts when [[Lunehymn]] and [[Aetherlight]] imbalance reaches a self-sustaining tipping point.

As for beings beyond the [[Known Universe]], [[Outer God]]s avoid [[Static Criticality]] by assuming an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]], which constrains their divine resonance into a stable vessel.
