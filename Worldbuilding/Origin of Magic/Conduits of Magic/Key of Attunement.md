Attuned Element [[Resonance]]. (Sound + Wind)

The art of harmony begins in serenity — when the self grows quiet enough to hear the world's song, and whole again to hold its own voice.

**Constraint:** The [[Spellweaver]]’s intent must align with their [[Fundamental Frequency]] soul-key. Potency is amplified by unwavering purpose and dampened by inner conflict.

**Personal Root & [[Motif Awakening]]:** Seeking belonging after isolation / Finding your place in the world. Those "Out of tune" who learn to align their soul-key to the world.

*"A string only rings true when perfectly tuned to the purpose of a key."*
