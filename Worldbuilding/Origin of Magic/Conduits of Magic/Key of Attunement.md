#### *Purpose, Identity and Self-Integrity
First Auric Thread of Wave Mechanics.*

Attuned Element [[Resonance]]. (Sound Waves + Wind)}

The third statement and popular magic principle of the of the [[Triadic Virtues of Spellcraft]]. It is the first auric thread of the [[Auric Heptacode]], and the only section of [[The Principles of Magic]] to stand only by itself. 

It has no other binding principles as it is the unique and direct manifestation of the [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Fundamental Frequency]]. Likewise, since all began with the [[Original Ripple]], it is too the basis of all existence. Attunement refers to the idea that everything has a soul-key — a state of self awareness that acknowledges the identity of one's [[Consciousness]] and rings true to its motif. It is akin to having an instrument in tune so that it can sound properly.

The principle depicts that the art of harmony begins in serenity — when the self grows quiet enough to hear the world's song, and whole again to hold its own voice. As a magic principle it states that the [[Spellweaver]]’s intent must align with their [[Fundamental Frequency]] soul-key. Potency of casting is amplified by an unwavering purpose and dampened by inner conflict. It forces the [[Spellweaver]] to know which "key" they are going to play in, and align all notes of their [[Soul Leitmotif]] accordingly. Playing out of tune creates [[Dissonance]] which resolves into chaos.

### Personal Root & [[Motif Awakening]]:

Seeking belonging after isolation / Finding your place in the world. Those "Out of tune" who learn to align their soul-key to the world.

*"A string only rings true when perfectly tuned to the purpose of a key."*
