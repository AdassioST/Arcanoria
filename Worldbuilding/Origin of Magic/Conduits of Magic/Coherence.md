How likely something is to exist, it is the contrary of chaos and [[Primal White Noise]]. Giving [[Coherence]] to the [[Known Universe]] is the primary objective of both the [[Auric Heptacode]] and the [[Trinity Harmony]]. It's a fundamental part of [[Spellweaving]] as well as it is the basis of [[Absolute Certainty]].

High [[Coherence]] forms [[Stable Harmonic Channels]] for information and magical transit through the [[Great Harmonic Loom]].

[[Coherence]] is not the absence of chaos, but rather a pattern so profound it can maintain integrity even at the edge of total dissolution.
