Description: *The cosmic score that binds all [[Ages]]. The song of all that has risen, fallen, and been buried across time.*

It is the great design of existence, the very fabric of the [[Known Universe]] and [[The Infinite Void]]. An infinite cosmic score predating time itself. It is the primal design of existence and fate, measured in the minimum of a [[Seventh]], divided by [[Act of Fate]]. It is the culmination that born [[The First Overtone]]. An unfurling, recursive melody where every [[Cycle]] is a piece of the soundtrack in its [[Divine Composition]].

Functionally, it serves as the mythic score of [[Arcanoria]]: unending, recursive, absolute. Its power flows through the [[Auric Heptacode]], as the world itself finds [[Consonance]] echoing the symmetry upon which existence rests.

[[The Eternal Symphony]] is not a gentle hymn, It is a relentless [[Cycle]] of peaks and abysses, of a savage fugue of [[Consonance]] and [[Dissonance]], of beginnings and ends. A graveyard of the only true chronicle of time. It preserves the [[Consciousness]], existence and soul of all living and sentient that has ever lived or will live, across all [[Ages]], present, past and future. Its movements are etched into the very fabric of the [[Auric Aria]], all [[Outer God]]s and every creation.

[[The Eternal Symphony]] predates existence and it's the first blank canvas, the single instant of all [[Potential of Creation]] to ever exist. The [[Original Ripple]] arising from causality into [[Flux]] in an instrument not yet touched, allowed for the eventual creation of [[Arcanoria]], the universe, and the [[True Mythos of Creation]].

*"It is said that no library nor historian preserves truth as faithfully as the [[The Eternal Symphony]]. Empires rot, monuments crumble, but their triumphs and failures endure as vibrations in this ageless composition. To hear it is to feel both glory and ruin, for it is built upon the carcasses of bygone [[Ages]]."
