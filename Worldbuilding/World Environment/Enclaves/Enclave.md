#settlement #landmark

A type of autonomous self-governing authority specialized in a particular activity that vary based on the [[Ages]] they're currently in. While [[Enclave]]s evolve over time, they have diplomacy distinct from other [[Civilization]]s or proper empires as they're city-states that can be interacted and integrated within a [[Civilization]]. Regardless of the type of [[Enclave]] they all shared the following:

- **Primary Function:** It's the essence of the [[Enclave]], and their vision statement. It's deeply related to their origin wound and serves as the purpose. A luminous observatory has the primary function of research advancement and technological discovery because truth is the highest calling. A forge-city with the essence of excellence through absolute concentration allows manufacturing and specialized crafting.

- **Economic Specialization:** What activities the [[Enclave]] specializes in to fulfil their primary function. it can range in many ways depending on the way each [[Enclave]] has encoded one of the seven bindings of [[The Principles of Magic]], going from cultural exports, to diplomatic missions, to baking bread. And even two [[Enclave]]s with a similar primary function can change significantly based on their wound and binding as it influences dramatically their activities.

- **Unique Mechanics:** These are gameplay mechanics that surround [[Enclave]]s, some affect missions, bonus effects, diplomacy, and [[Suzerainty]] bonuses. For example, an [[Indulgent Enclave]] specialized in harmonic [[Resonance]] broadcasts offers [[Civilization]]s a "cultural frequency" that other settlements attune to. If the [[Civilization]] chooses to adopt this frequency, they gain happiness and cultural generation but lose some autonomy where they can't adopt certain cultural policies without the [[Indulgent Enclave]]'s approval.

- **Integration Bonuses:** When [[Enclave]]s are integrated into a [[Civilization]] through a merger diplomatic resolution, or sustain an expanded [[Suzerainty]] status, they don't cede their autonomy, instead on integration they retain their uniqueness. The same [[Indulgent Enclave]] when integrated grants the parent [[Civilization]] a permanent +25% cultural generation globally and unlocks "Harmonized" reforms that reduce inter-settlement tensions.

- **Origin Wound:** This is the narrative foundation, world-building flavor and the "Why" of [[Enclave]]s. In a nutshell, [[Enclave]]s are formed as communities of [[Spellweaver]]s trying to find meaning on hardship and communal trauma. The [[Indulgent Enclave]] could be a society formed by refugees of artistic repression fleeing tyranny, or survivors of cultural genocide seeking to preserve memory in a new form. A bakery [[Enclave]] could be formed from a beloved baker who was executed during plague panic as a scapegoat. The family refuses to let them be forgotten and they begin building a bakery community that eventually becomes an [[Enclave]] which serves as a memorial (recipes preserve their memory), a cultural sanctuary (people gather, share stories) and a source of happiness.

### Evolution of [[Enclave]]s across [[Ages]]

Likewise, [[Enclave]]s are not static societies, they tend to have an advanced technological niche that keeps them relevant as autonomous sovereign states, and depending on their history through the [[Events]] [[Civilization]] encounters and their leaders their origin wound can manifest in several expressions too:

- **Healing Path** – Wound processed, enclave becomes integrated, stable.
- **Acceptance Path** – Wound acknowledged and woven into identity.
- **Denial Path** – Wound ignored; obsession, overcompensation.
- **Weaponization Path** – Wound turned into power (revenge, extremism).

An underlying wound can be either a wholesome healing community (sharing recipes, building solidarity) or an obsessive cult-like [[Enclave]] (unhealthy fixation on legacy). This flexibility is intentional: it supports tone diversity from cozy to grim. This is further supported by the [[Enclave]]'s [[Wound Resonance]]. A conceptual 0–100 scale describing how strongly the enclave is still “powered” by its founding trauma. It exists in three states:

- **75–100** – Raw, acute trauma: Maximum output, but unstable and prone to obsession or weaponization.

- **40–75** – Integrated wound: Stable production, strong identity, healthiest state.

- **0–40** – Forgotten wound: [[Enclave]] becomes susceptible to dissolution or fall; loses uniqueness progressively and it's usually a death sentence, but it is also the reformation period for a new [[Enclave]] to emerge from the ashes.

Finally, if there are enough [[Ages]] of a stable [[Enclave]] without [[Suzerainty]] or integration into a [[Civilization]]. They can evolve to become their own [[Civilization]]. [[Enclave]]s also serve to fill the niche of new forming [[Civilization]]s and empires that aren't yet established on game start, and if given enough authority, [[City Development]], and lack of integration, they will become another player in [[Arcanoria]].

### The Horizontal Worldbuilding of [[Enclave]]s

[[Enclave]]s are varied having both a general category of activities across 10 groups, and a binding alignment. Categories describe the [[Enclave]]'s functional niche in [[Arcanoria]]. The list of the categories is the following:

- [[Agromagical Enclave]]: Growth, Health, Sanitation, Sustenance.
- [[Militant Enclave]]: Tactics, Weapons, Mercenaries, Hunters.
- [[Auric Enclave]]: [[Aureus Pillar]], [[Piety]], [[Faith]], Knowledge, Science.
- [[Weaver Enclave]]: [[Waltz Pillar]], Culture, Poetry, Songs, Communal Arts.
- [[Domestication Enclave]]: Creatures, [[Pure Light]], Taming, Druids.
- [[Trading Enclave]]: Economics, Wealth, [[Resources]], Efficiency. 
- [[Industrious Enclave]]: Equipment, Forges, Artisans, Metalworks.
- [[Regal Enclave]]: [[Regalia Pillar]], Politics, Diplomacy, Prestige, Espionage.
- [[Indulgent Enclave]]: Entertainment, Pleasure, Joy, Luxuries,
- [[Esoteric Enclave]]: [[Chorus Pillar]], [[Outer God]]s, Dark [[Magic Arts]], Witchcraft, Spirits.

Furthermore, each [[Enclave]] can be tuned with a binding affecting their flavor. As the same [[Enclave]] with a different binding changes their perception and behavior of their original wound. For example, a [[Militant Enclave]] with [[Cindergale]] becomes a fast, aggressive, high-risk cavalry, while one with [[Crystal]] is instead of impregnable defensive lines and long-term planning, or a [[Void]] is elite units with devastating [[Spellweaving]] but are hard to manage and usually incur heavy losses.

Besides their flavor [[Enclave]]s also offer varying narrative storylines on the proximity of the [[Civilization]] which have developing [[Legend]]s that can be influenced through diplomacy, trade, and decision-making storylines. This gives an added bonus of having a look at the rest of the world, and increase the horizontal development of the worldbuilding. The [[Enclave]] system is designed to produce every major function of [[Civilization]] while having enough tone flexibility to have wholesome, bittersweet, or dark themes, and the emergent narratives arise from the combination of the properties of [[Enclave]]s, their relationships with one another, the [[Trade Routes]] and their influence in [[Trade Nexus]].

This varying category can be set along a spectrum where the same activities can be either pure wholesome in healing, joy, connection, kindness, or as pure dark with exploitation, obsession, and despair. The varying degrees of versatility have any type of [[Enclave]] adjusting by their narrative development, their responses to [[Dark Age]] and [[Golden Age]]s, and the [[Age Crisis]] as an origin wound to either their foundation or their response. A few examples of these degrees can be understood like this:

- [[Weaver Enclave]]: 
	- A bakery preserving the lost recipes of those who died to the [[Great Plague]] as wholesome. 
	- Bard circles narrating forbidden stories of esoteric or hazardous knowledge as versatile.
	- Puppet theaters used as propaganda for a tyrannical [[Civilization]] or for furthering agendas that incite political drama as dark.
- [[Domestication Enclave]]:
	- Petting zoos and sanctuaries of [[Pure Light]] [[Slimes]] that developed from the interaction with [[Pure Light]] beings and [[Agromagical Enclave]]s as wholesome.
	- War-beast stables with ethical treatment and selective breeding of the animals care as versatile.
	- Exploitative experimentation of creatures with the purpose of creating engineered destruction and submissive, loyal weapons as dark.
        

The tone is largely [[Civilization]] and narrative-choice driven, with no moral guidelines determining the impact or growth, and [[Enclave]]s gradually imprint [[Civilization]]-wide values, such as gratitude for food, humor as wisdom, ethical warfare, wisdom as communal, or coexistence with nature. Contrasting [[Enclave]]s values create tension while shared values [[Consonance]]. Providing texture and distinct identities of [[Civilization]] to [[Enclave]] and [[Enclave]] to [[Enclave]] relationships.

Likewise, some of the [[Enclave]]s serve to increase the contrast of dark and light in dark fantasy, this means that some will be goofy but meaningful. For example:

- **The [[Sprite-Light Conclave]]**: A [[Domestication Enclave]] of [[Pure Light]] [[Elemental Sprite]]s that developed coexistence with strange creatures preceding the slimes; they have a playful but deep history for the first [[Ages]].
    
- **The Singing Circle**: A [[Weaver Enclave]] reclaiming music as the essence of life against loss; simple joy as resistance to the [[Inevitability of Death]].
    
- **All-Welcome Cozy Inn**: An [[Indulgent Enclave]] that is a safe refuge for travelers, found family vibe. It was made by a band of orphaned children that grew up to believe everyone deserves a place to live, to travel, to enjoy life.
    
- **The Moonlit Gardens**: An [[Agromagical Enclave]] with [[Lunehymn]]-infused plants of grief turned into healing beauty. 
    
These provide wholesome, cozy stories within a dark world, raising overall emotional richness, and some also present the advancement and evolution of magic. The [[Sprite-Light Conclave]] is the explanation of how [[Elemental Sprite]]s came to shape as [[Slimes]] by the progressive development of [[Pure Light]] beings.

### [[Age Crisis]] as catalysts for [[Enclave]]s

[[Enclave]]s shine the most during [[Age Crisis]], as they're places that either enabled as a catalyst, as a response to an [[Age Crisis]] or as prevention for dampening the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]]. All [[Enclave]]s are born from an original wound, and several of the collective wounds come from the survivors of an [[Age Crisis]]. 

At the start of the game, there's almost no [[Enclave]]s, just separate tribal societies in the [[Age of Desolation]] struggling for survival. This leads to the development of the first [[Militant Enclave]] and [[Trading Enclave]]s, as survival mechanisms amongst the survivors of the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]]. When the [[Age Crisis]] of [[The Inescapable Hunger]] appears, it leads to terrible famines all across [[Arcanoria]], the survivors of the aftermath come to create [[Agromagical Enclave]]s as the [[Age of Renewal]] fully recaptures [[Spellweaving]] potency, and they adopt a mentality of "never again" to the famines. 

Some of these [[Enclave]]s further pursue this idea by transforming food into meaning, the [[Weaver Enclave]] or [[Indulgent Enclave]]s appear as a response of having luxuries and culture intertwined in food, like developing a bakery that isn't solely food, but meaning on the lost recipes as a mourning response to those who died during [[The Inescapable Hunger]]. This also presents dynamics where [[Agromagical Enclave]]s are helpful in developing the techniques for irrigation and growth that [[Weaver Enclave]] and [[Indulgent Enclave]]s use to then create their bread, crafting a dynamic structure of interdependency in logistics, trade, and giving a purpose to [[Trade Routes]] and [[Trade Nexus]], making the world "livable" and coexisting with [[Civilization]].

When other [[Age Crisis]] appear, [[Enclave]]s can still produce stories related to them. For example, in the [[Age of Renewal]] as magic becomes primordial it causes the [[Great Plague]] from exploitation. The vectors, the [[Luminant Moths]], are originally traded by [[Domestication Enclave]]s during the age. It's until midway of the [[Great Plague]] that [[Civilization]] realizes that they're the carriers of [[Luminant Decay]]. The [[Domestication Enclave]] was an enabler for the [[Age Crisis]], yet they can help in culling population, understanding the depth of the biological relationship and potentially give methods to prevent the catastrophic spiral.

Other types of [[Enclave]]s like [[Auric Enclave]]s can aid [[Domestication Enclave]]s with research, [[Faith]], and knowledge to work in tandem for a cure or to develop the magical waxed used by plague doctors to act as responses for the [[Dissonance bloom]]. Thus, the complex layer of interactions between [[Enclave]]s and [[Civilization]] enrich the world to the point that we have [[Auric Enclave]] explaining the [[Great Plague]]scientifically, and interprets its meaning theologically while [[Domestication Enclave]]s in tandem with [[Agromagical Enclave]]s provide the means of deterring, sanitizing, and controlling [[Luminant Moths]].

[[Industrious Enclave]]s will appear as alternatives to [[Pure Light]] streetlights by offering a safe, non-[[Luminant Moths]]-based light. It can help to reduce the infection rates too if invested in early enough. [[Age Crisis]] are a stress test of [[Arcanoria]]’s [[Civilization]]s horizontal infrastructure while providing narrative breadth and depth.

Finally, not all [[Enclave]]s will survive, which creates a tragedy on the application of limited resources maximizing player agency by choosing who are the survivors that will rebuild [[Civilization]] after the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]]. It makes also the previously goofy but meaningful [[Enclave]]s even more potent, because it creates dynamics where [[Civilization]] will try to save the [[Sprite-Light Conclave]] as they became attached to the [[Elemental Sprite]]s and the [[Slimes]], it is the light worth saving in a universe of encroaching dark fantasy.

[[Enclave]]s combine to answer: _What does [[Civilization]] value, and who are the survivors that will shape the next [[Ages]]?_
