#faith

A concept popularized by dogmatic schools of [[The One True God]]. The principle is based on the idea that [[Humanity]] was made in the image and likeliness of the [[Auric Aria]]. It emphasizes the virtues of being a perfect mirror as a reflection of the creator. Trying to make people come close to the divine by aspiring to be as similar as the [[Auric Aria]]. Albeit it feverously censors and denies her shortcomings considering the [[First Weaving of Life]] one of the most blasphemous texts.

In the principles of [[Perfect Reflection]], it considers the [[Perfect Manifestation of Life]] as the most desirable trait of any living [[Consciousness]]. In spellcraft, it introduces the [[Triadic Virtues of Spellcraft]] for masterfully weaving the seven bindings of the [[Auric Heptacode]].
