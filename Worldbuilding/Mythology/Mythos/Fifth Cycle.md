The [[Fifth Cycle]] of the [[Seven-Day Creation]] of [[Arcanoria]].

What happened in this cycle greatly depends on either the [[Auric Mythos of Creation]] or the [[True Mythos of Creation]].

In truth, it is the [[Cycle]] where the [[Corruption]] in Pandora’s Box opened after a mistake from the [[Auric Aria]] on the [[First Weaving of Life]], causing the original [[Dissonance]], the [[Inevitability of Death]] and the first [[Atonalis]], the [[Original Eight]] from the first [[Formless Masses]]. This [[Cycle]] proved the powerlessness of the [[Auric Aria]] by lacking [[Sufficient Precision]] of modifying the world directly and proved that she is too a flawed artist.

The end of this cycle also saw the introduction of [[Selenea]] into the history of [[Arcanoria]], an [[Outer God]] who breathed vitality into the [[First Living Being]], a [[Fated Flower]], as the first [[Perfect Manifestation of Life]]. The capacity of [[Selenea]] to imbue creations with a unique [[Fundamental Frequency]] convinced the [[Auric Aria]] to collaborate on creating the rest of [[Arcanoria]].
