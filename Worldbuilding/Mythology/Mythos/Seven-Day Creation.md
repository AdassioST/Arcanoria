The mythical tale of how [[Arcanoria]] was made in seven [[Cycle]]s by the [[Auric Aria]]. It is part of the classical [[Auric Mythos of Creation]] which is conformed of:

The [[First Cycle]], [[Second Cycle]], [[Third Cycle]], [[Fourth Cycle]]. [[Fifth Cycle]], [[Sixth Cycle]]. [[Seventh Cycle]].

The [[True Mythos of Creation]], however details an [[Eighth Cycle]], blasphemous and outside of the [[Auric Mythos of Creation]], in which magic was actually imbued within the world after the sacrifice in flesh of the [[Auric Aria]].
