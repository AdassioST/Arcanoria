Any other deity born on [[The Infinite Void]] that is not [[The One True God]]. They are all heavily despised by the [[Auric Aria]].

They extend influence beyond the [[Known Universe]] and can only manifest with the help of flesh-bound vessels as they are too vast to enter physicality and lack [[Sufficient Precision]] to modify directly [[Arcanoria]].

However, it is possible to give an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]] to these beings to modify [[Arcanoria]], through either a [[Celestial Ensnaring Mirror]] or via a [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]]. The [[Auric Aria]] is the only celestial being able to manifest shape in the [[Known Universe]] at will but the process of weaving a vessel leaves her exhausted and powerless for three [[Cycle]]s.

[[Selenea]] is a special [[Outer God]] fundamental in the [[True Mythos of Creation]] with an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]] due to the betrayal of the [[Moon]] by the [[Auric Aria]]. However, any [[Outer God]], either malignant or chaotic, willing to gain influence in [[Arcanoria]] will try to gain [[Sufficient Precision]] and an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]] by deceiving [[Humanity]] into sealing a vessel in a [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]].
