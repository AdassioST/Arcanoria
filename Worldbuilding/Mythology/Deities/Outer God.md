Any other deity born on [[The Infinite Void]] that is not [[The One True God]]. 

They extend influence beyond the [[Known Universe]] and can only manifest with the help of flesh-bound vessels as they are too vast to enter and lack [[Sufficient Precision]] to modify directly [[Arcanoria]].

They are all heavily despised by the [[Auric Aria]].
