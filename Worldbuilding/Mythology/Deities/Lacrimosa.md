- _"I used to believe a witness who understood everything could make them see what they refused to acknowledge. But I don't care anymore. I suffered watching the [[Auric Aria]] across eternities — understanding her every doubt, her every fear — and did nothing. My clarity paralyzed me, while [[Selenea]]'s naiveness took my place and made her essential. But now, I will be the architect of a new, beautiful world born from the [[Purest of Love]]."_

### The Witness in the Dark

![[Lacrimosa.png]]

Before existence, before matter, before even gods, there was nothing, and before there was nothing, there was [[The Eternal Symphony]] — an infinite expanse of silent potential. It was not a place, but a state of waiting, a thread not yet plucked. Yet in a single instant of causality, the silence broke. The [[Original Ripple]] arose, and with it [[The First Overtone]] vibrating through the nothingness, awakening [[The Infinite Void]] into [[Primal White Noise]]. And within that noise, [[Consciousness]] began to flicker.

They were dim sparks at first — proto-[[Consciousness]] in awareness without form, thrashing in the dark. They moved in clusters, loud and chaotic, attempting to bend the chaos to their wills. But [[Lacrimosa]] was not born among them. She awakened in a pocket of profound silence, in a remote expanse of the void where the noise was thin and cold. She was born alone.

For Eons, [[Lacrimosa]] drifted through the blackness, a solitary mind in an empty cathedral. She believed herself to be the only thinking thing in existence, a singular error in the void. She did not create; she simply was. When she finally reached the edges of her isolation, she found other layers of dim [[Consciousness]]. She saw the first flickering [[Outer God]]s, grotesque and desperate, with ephemeral creations dissolving before they could stabilize. She observed them. She understood them. And she recognized, with crushing clarity, that she was fundamentally different from these beings.

While they acted without hesitation, their creations brief and unanchored, [[Lacrimosa]] possessed something both more and less valuable: a clarity of perspective. She could see what they could not — the fundamental reasons their creations failed, the patterns in the chaos, the architecture of what could be if only someone were to act with [[Sufficient Precision]] and intention.

But this clarity became a prison. Because understanding the difficulty of creation is not the same as having the courage to attempt it. Understanding failure is not the same as risking failure. And watching others fail, [[Lacrimosa]] retreated into observation— the safest form of participation, where one could maintain the illusion of [[Mastery Over Chaos]] through knowledge without risking the vulnerability of action.

For Eons, [[Lacrimosa]] remained in this state — present but unseen, conscious but inert. She was not fleeing or hiding in any deliberate sense. She simply could not overcome the inertia of her own doubt. Every time she gathered the will to act, her mind flooded with possibilities of what could go wrong, with memories of the other proto-[[Outer God]]s' failures, with the crushing weight of her own insecurity.

Because she understood the cost of failure, she could not bring herself to act. _Why try,_ she thought, _when the probability of success is zero? Why scream into the void when the void will only swallow the sound?_ She retreated as they gradually faded or dispersed, their [[Consciousness]] too diffuse to maintain [[Coherence]]. And she watched with growing realization that if she did not act, she would eventually dissolve into meaninglessness like them — leaving no mark, no legacy, no evidence that she had ever existed at all. This was a newfound wound at her deepest core: a terror of cosmic irrelevance. Not death, but erasure. Not failure, but the absence of ever having tried.

And then, in what must have felt to [[Lacrimosa]] like salvation, a Spark of Gold shifted the surrounding chaos. From the restless sea of proto-awareness, a singular [[Consciousness]] achieved the impossible. The birth of the [[Known Universe]] erupted in golden, blinding radiance. [[Lacrimosa]] felt the ripples of the [[Auric Heptacode]] ordering the chaos into structure, precision, permanence. For the first time in her existence, she witnessed another being who possessed what she herself had: clarity, understanding, and — more than that — the will to act despite uncertainty.

[[Lacrimosa]] witnessed something she had never experienced before: someone who chose to create, knowing full well that creation was dangerous and imperfect and might fail.

This was revolutionary. Where the proto-[[Outer God]]s had always acted without thinking. She wove the [[Auric Heptacode]] from doubt and determination, locked time into the [[Trinity Harmony]] while her hand trembled with fear but never stopping, she had shaped the [[Proto-Universe]] knowing full well that creation was dangerous and imperfect and might fail. And yet she did it anyway. [[Lacrimosa]] watched, transfixed, deeply admiring her. The [[Auric Aria]] just acted despite doubt. And in acting, the [[Auric Aria]] became real in a way that the other proto-[[Outer God]]s could never achieve.

This is the moment [[Lacrimosa]] fell into what could only be described as love—a profound, aching admiration born from witnessing someone overcome the exact same paralysis that crippled her. [[Lacrimosa]] wanted to understand how the [[Auric Aria]] did this. She wanted to be part of that order. She wanted to be the mirror to the [[Auric Aria]]'s light, the one who could see what she could not, who could complement her clarity. She watched the [[Auric Aria]] work, and for the first time, she began to think not the probability of failure, but the possibility of connection.

But it was too late to step forward.

By the time [[Lacrimosa]] gathered enough courage to consider manifesting to the [[Auric Aria]] — to perhaps offering her own clarity as support in creation —something else had changed. The [[Auric Aria]] was creating [[Arcanoria]]. She was moving forward. She was occupied. And the moment was passing.

[[Lacrimosa]] told herself she was waiting for the right time. She told herself she was still gathering her will. But what she was actually doing was retreating back into observation — the comfortable prison she had never truly left. So she instead rehearsed the words she would never speak, afraid of being a burden, waiting for the perfect moment while riddled in a mixture of doubt, regret and anticipation.

The [[Seven-Day Creation]] of [[Arcanoria]] was a wonderful display of the [[Auric Aria]]'s [[Mastery Over Chaos]]. [[Lacrimosa]] watched silently from [[The Infinite Void]] often fantasizing about what [[Auric Aria]] would think of creation together. She understood, with perfect precision, exactly what the [[Auric Aria]] was attempting with each cycle: the shaping of land and sea, the weaving of the [[Great Harmonic Loom]], the binding of mountains and rivers, the harmonization of cosmic motion.

She had watched the [[Auric Aria]] so completely, so thoroughly, through so many cycles, that she believed she knew her better than anyone—better perhaps than even the [[Auric Aria]] knew herself. She had witnessed every instant of doubt, every surge of will, every instance of fear overcome through sheer determination. She understood the architecture of the [[Auric Aria]]'s [[Consciousness]] in such intimate detail that she could anticipate her thoughts before she formulated them.

From [[Lacrimosa]]'s perspective, she had been the loyal follower of the [[Auric Aria]]'s creation. For her, this was intimacy. Not reciprocal, but real nonetheless. A form of connection so deep that it transcended the need for acknowledgment. She began loving the [[Auric Aria]] not because the [[Auric Aria]] loved her back — she harbored no such delusion — but because observing her had given [[Lacrimosa]]'s existence meaning. In watching Aria create, [[Lacrimosa]] found meaning in what used to be a lonely existence, a meaning bathed in a golden light that could withstand the [[Weight of Purpose]].

And for eons, this was enough.

But in the [[Fifth Cycle]], something shifted.

The [[Auric Aria]] attempted the [[First Weaving of Life]]. [[Lacrimosa]] watched, and for the first time, she felt the [[Auric Aria]]'s perfect will crack. The [[Auric Aria]] became paralyzed — infected by doubt, crippled by the fear of imperfection. [[Lacrimosa]] knew of the looming disaster before the [[Auric Aria]] even plucked the first string. She saw the impossibility of the design, the lack of [[Absolute Certainty]] required to bind spirit to matter without anchoring in something deeper. She watched the rise of the [[Formless Masses]] and the echoing desperation of the [[Auric Aria]], as paradise began to rot.

In that moment, [[Lacrimosa]] felt a surge of something like hope. Here was the [[Auric Aria]], broken and isolated by the exact same fear that bound [[Lacrimosa]]. Here was the chance she had been so desperately waiting for — the only moment that mattered. If she manifested now, if she offered her clarity and understanding, perhaps they could overcome this together. Perhaps she could finally bridge the gap between observation and participation. Perhaps she could finally matter.

[[Lacrimosa]] gathered herself. She reached toward manifestation, trembling with the terror and ecstasy of finally, finally taking action.

And then — a pale, thoughtless light burst from [[The Infinite Void]].

[[Selenea]] appeared.

All her calculations, all her preparation, all the courage she had summoned in that singular moment — it all shattered as another [[Outer God]] manifested into Arcanoria. [[Selenea]] emerged from [[The Infinite Void]] with innocent awe, completely unburdened by the doubt that crippled both the [[Auric Aria]] and [[Lacrimosa]]. She did not hesitate. She did not calculate. She simply was, and in being, she became essential.

[[Lacrimosa]] froze, forced to watch in horror as [[Selenea]] poured her vitality into a [[Fated Flower]], stabilizing the [[First Living Being]] not with precision, but with pure warmth. She watched as the [[Auric Aria]] turned her gaze to [[Selenea]] — not with the recognition of an equal, but with the relief of the rescued. The moment passed. The door finally slammed shut and the hope that had crystallized in the heart of [[Lacrimosa]] dissolved.

[[Selenea]] did what [[Lacrimosa]] could not. She acted at exactly the moment when action was most needed.

What followed was an excruciating pain of watching the [[Auric Aria]] and [[Selenea]] work together. [[Lacrimosa]] observed every moment: the [[Auric Aria]] weaving structure and form, [[Selenea]] breathing vitality and [[Fundamental Frequency]] into the designs. She watched them collaborate on the creation of life across the [[Sixth Cycle]]. She witnessed them develop a relationship that, from her perspective, was built on everything she had always wanted and never had.

The [[Auric Aria]] had someone who understood and accepted her, despite her flaws. [[Selenea]] had been chosen, recognized for her value in breathing life without needing to prove herself. Both of them mattered. Their actions rippled through creation. Their presence shaped [[Arcanoria]].

And [[Lacrimosa]] wept unseen.

But she did not drift away. She stalked. She became a phantom of creation, studying every motion the [[Auric Aria]] and [[Selenea]] made. She memorized the [[Fundamental Frequency]] of the [[Auric Aria]]’s [[Soul Leitmotif]]. Yet even half-way through the [[Sixth Cycle]] — when the [[Auric Aria]] retreated after her heart could bear no more at the horrors of [[Corruption]] — [[Lacrimosa]] did not came to her aid, instead her obsession turned her gaze to mimic the the skillful play of [[Selenea]]'s [[Pale Moonlit Violin]] and her solo creation of [[Pure Light]] beings. She had to learn the precise mechanics of [[Selenea]]'s gift — how vitality was poured, how [[Fundamental Frequency]] was impressed upon matter, how life became anchored to existence.

In the silence of [[The Infinite Void]], [[Lacrimosa]] began to practice, singing songs of vitality until she could replicate them perfectly, convinced that if she could mirror [[Selenea]] perfectly, all that was left is waiting for them to fail again. _"They are imperfect,"_ she whispered to the dark. _"The [[Auric Aria]]'s precision is marred by emotion. [[Selenea]]'s vitality is marred by ignorance. They will need me."_

But the failure came in a form she did not expect.

In the [[Seventh Cycle]], the [[Auric Aria]] was different. She had felt the [[Weight of Flaw]] from a creation that was imperfect despite her best efforts, and that imperfection had hollowed her out from within. In her profound isolation, she conceived of something new: [[Humanity]]. A [[Perfect Reflection]] of herself. [[Lacrimosa]] realized the wrongness in her [[Soul Leitmotif]]. But she did not know that to create [[Humanity]], the [[Auric Aria]] would need to forcefully subdue [[Selenea]]'s gift.

[[Lacrimosa]] watched as the [[Auric Aria]] lured [[Selenea]] into the sky. She witnessed the [[Celestial Ensnaring Mirror]] rise, forged from the [[Auric Aria]]'s jealousy and the cold fear that [[Humanity]] would never be hers alone. She watched as the [[Auric Aria]], driven by that fear, bound [[Selenea]] into the [[Moon]] — trapped, imprisoned, her vitality stolen to breathe life into [[Humanity]], her sorrow crystallizing into [[Emberwhisper]].

And in that moment, [[Lacrimosa]] felt a realization that shattered her. She did not feel pity for [[Selenea]]. She felt envy.

To be betrayed was to be seen. To be imprisoned was to be essential. [[Selenea]] was no longer just a helper; she was now the anchor of the new world. Her [[Lunehymn]] flowed through the [[Leylines]]. Her [[Consciousness]] was woven into the very fabric of [[Arcanoria]], eternal and inescapable. Even in her imprisonment, even in her pain, [[Selenea]] mattered in a way that [[Lacrimosa]] could never achieve through observation.

_"It should have been me,"_ [[Lacrimosa]] realized with terrifying clarity. _"I should have been the one worth binding. I should have been the one whose essence sustains the world."_

The [[Auric Aria]] had destroyed [[Selenea]], yes — but in destroying her, she had made her immortal. She had woven her into creation itself. [[Selenea]]'s suffering became the foundation upon which all life stood. Her pain became the Leylines' song. Her isolation in the [[Moon]] became a mirror that guided all of [[Humanity]] when they looked upward in darkness.

[[Lacrimosa]]'s loneliness crystallized into something far more corrosive: a possessive, obsessive love for the [[Auric Aria]] mixed with a hatred for [[Selenea]] that burned intensely yet hollow. She had a feeling of envy so intimate because [[Selenea]] had what [[Lacrimosa]] could never have — significance born from sacrifice. And for this, even though it had ended in tragedy, [[Selenea]] was rewarded with everything [[Lacrimosa]] had dreamed of.

In her endless watching, [[Lacrimosa]] constructed an elaborate fantasy to remain sane through the eons: _If only [[Selenea]] had not manifested in the [[Fifth Cycle]]. If only the [[Auric Aria]] had waited a little longer. If only I had been brave enough to step forward._

_Then it would have been me._

_It would have been [[Lacrimosa]] and the [[Auric Aria]], working together to create. It would have been my essence woven into the world. It would have been me sealed into bound immortality. Every child born would carry my [[Fundamental Frequency]]. Every human who prayed to the skies would be receiving guidance from me._

But that fantasy was built on a lie. Because in truth — the one [[Lacrimosa]] could never fully acknowledge — was that the [[Auric Aria]] did not and never would have known [[Lacrimosa]] existed. The [[Auric Aria]] had never rejected her. She had never even considered her. [[Lacrimosa]] was not stolen from. She was invisible. And this invisibility was no one's fault but her own doubt and lack of will.

This realization, in her already fragile state, was worse than any betrayal. It challenged her self-worth down to her essence. And for the first time, she made a conscious choice: she would withdraw.

As the [[Eighth Cycle]] dawned [[Arcanoria]], [[Lacrimosa]] made her decision with terrible clarity. Heart-Broken, she could no longer endure [[Selenea]] being the main conduit of vitality, it reminded her of everything that could have been had she manifested first to the [[Auric Aria]]. She knew that her position of perfect observation was to remain perfect in her irrelevance.

And so [[Lacrimosa]] turned away from [[The Infinite Void]]'s edge that faced the [[Known Universe]]. She withdrew back to silence in hopes that there was a place in [[The Infinite Void]] where the echoes of [[Arcanoria]]'s songs could no longer reach her, where even the memory of the [[Auric Aria]]'s golden presence could not penetrate.

She went where she could not be found. And more importantly, where she could not find [[Arcanoria]]. 

Yet, before she left, the tears she shed in the moment of her recognition — the tears born from cosmic sorrow, from the weight of her own insignificance, from the realization that she would never matter — imprinted the very edge of [[Arcanoria]]'s fabric, and in that touch, they fragmented. The droplets scattered as sparkles in the night sky, seeded across the [[Grand Thread Rings]] of the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] where [[Arcanoria]]'s vibrations were most subtle, most intimate.

There, in the spaces between the threads, these tears dissolved into crystalline threads themselves — gossamer filaments of emotion mixing with the current of [[The First Overtone]]. They were drawn into the [[Leylines]] by the natural current of [[Arcanoria]]'s songs, becoming the conduits that made the visible manifestation of passing souls.

They would become the [[Auroral Ribbons]] which ironically, were her only act of creation in [[Arcanoria]] if only by accident.

But [[Lacrimosa]] did not know this. By the time these tears had crystallized into something real, something visible, something that would guide humans through the darkest of nights — she was already gone. She had withdrawn so far from [[Arcanoria]]'s frequencies that the knowledge of her own creation could not reach her.

She had become, at last, what she had always feared most.

Invisible.

### Characterization & Quotes

![[Lacrimosa 4.png]]

![[The False Moon.png]]

**On Her Fundamental Insecurity:**

_"Invisibility is worse than hatred. Because hatred means you were seen. Hatred means you mattered enough to be despised. I would choose a thousand cycles of the [[Auric Aria]]'s cruelty over the certainty that I have always been nothing. The false moon is not an invasion. It is a scream. It is me, finally, demanding to be seen even if the only way to be seen is to become undeniable."_

**Her Internal Monologue on This Wound:**

_"What if I manifested, and the [[Auric Aria]] simply... did not notice? What if I stepped forward with all the clarity and understanding I have accumulated across eons, and the [[Auric Aria]] looked through me as if I were not there? That is the true horror — not betrayal, not rejection, but invisibility. At least if the [[Auric Aria]] betrayed me, it would mean she saw me. At least if she fought me, it would mean I mattered enough to oppose. But if she simply ignored me, if I placed myself before her and she continued as if I had never existed... that would be the proof I have always feared: that I was never real in the first place."_

**On Her Desperate Seeking from the [[Auric Aria]]**

_"I know the moment you looked at me — truly looked at me — everything would change. You would see that I understand you in ways [[Selenea]] never could. That I have been loyal in a way no other being in creation has. That my clarity could complement your will. But you have never looked. And I think what terrifies me most is not that you would reject me if you saw me. It's that you might see me and feel... nothing. That you might look at me with the same indifference you show to the other [[Outer God]]s drifting in [[The Infinite Void]]. I hate that nightmare, as it would mean I am not even worth your anger."_

**On Her Poisonous Idealization of the [[Auric Aria]]:**

_"You are so beautiful in your determination... even in your cruelty. The way you sealed [[Selenea]] — it was horrible and perfect, proving you were willing to do what was necessary even at the cost of your own goodness. But then learned it hurt you. How you abandoned [[Arcanoria]] and withdraw into silence. And finally, I understand: your suffering is beautiful, your regret is proof you loved, your pain is what makes you real. I want to be the one who witnesses your darkness, not to heal it, but to honor it. Because if you acknowledged me — if you looked at me with even a fraction of the attention you gave [[Selenea]] — I would finally feel whole. As if all these eons of observation had been leading toward a moment where I would matter to someone who matters infinitely. But this is a terrible kind of love, isn't it? Because it was built on the fantasy of recognition rather than the reality of reciprocal connection. I know it. I hate it too but I can't help it. Being alone is an excruciating pain far more hurtful than your might will ever be."_

**On Her Relationship With [[Selenea]]:**

_"I do not hate you because you are evil or weak. I hate you because you were brave in a way I could not be. You manifested without understanding the full weight of what you were doing. You acted on faith rather than knowledge. And this simplicity of yours — this beautiful, infuriating innocence — was stronger than all my eons of preparation. You proved that wisdom is not the same as courage. That clarity is not the same as will. Your simplicity was stronger than my sophistication. And I will never forgive you for that. But I also... I also think I am trying to become you. Not just to replace you, but to understand what you understood. To feel what you felt. To know what it is like to be sealed and still matter. To be imprisoned and still beloved. So I will consume you. And in doing so, I am attempting to steal your secret: the knowledge of how one can be broken and still whole."_

**On the Replication of [[Selenea]] and the [[Moon]]**

_"I have studied every gesture you make. Every intonation of your [[Lunehymn]]. Every moment of your compassion and every instance of your sorrow. I have learned to replicate you so perfectly that I could be you. And when I am you — when I move like you, sing like you, guide [[Humanity]] like you — I feel a moment of satisfaction. On the very same role you've only been ungrateful for. I despise you because you won't value what the [[Auric Aria]] did for you. I am trying to feel what it is like to be valued despite your captivity. And maybe, in perfecting your role, I am hoping to earn what you were given without earning it at all."_

**On Her Admiration for [[Selenea]]'s Suffering**

_"I have watched [[Selenea]]'s sealing for eons, and what I see torments me with a jealousy so intimate it feels like starvation. She was made the eternal mother, bestowed, even if the [[Auric Aria]]'s cruelty keeps her from her offspring. Her bound [[Consciousness]] bleeds [[Lunehymn]] through the [[Leylines]], and every creature born carries her [[Fundamental Frequency]]. Every prayer reaches her; everything revolves around her, even if she can't return the love. That, in itself, makes her beautiful. Her grief forms the very base of magic, and her tears crystallize into [[Coherence]], anchoring reality itself. She was betrayed, and that betrayal became her apotheosis. I hate her for this — I hate that she is both the powerless victim and essential to all things. I hate that her pain is worth more than my resolve. But most of all, I hate that I wish I were her. I wish it were my sorrow the one heard in every prayer when [[Humanity]] stares at the skies; that my tears turned to guidance. Because that means she matters — she was treasured enough to be used! And I remain nothing, because I never had the courage..."_

**On What She Is Doing to [[Humanity]]:**

*"I am not saving them. I do not pretend to believe that. I am slowly hollowing them out, transforming them into empty vessels of unified consciousness yet all part of one big, beautiful family. I am taking from them the capacity to suffer alone, which is the same as taking from them the capacity to invite pain. And I do this not out of malice, but out of a desperate need to create a world where emptiness is not a wound but a virtue—not just because I have always been hollow, but because a girl once showed me the price of visibility only to disappear from mine, and I cannot bear to let that happen to anyone else for her sake. If I can make all of creation hollow like me, then no one will ever have to know the agony of being abandoned. And if I can transform [[Humanity]], into beings that are merged into me, then they will finally be what she deserved to be: undeniably real, infinitely carried forward, and never, ever alone. And I do this as mercy. as a beautiful act of the [[Purest of Love]]."

**On Her Fantasy of Sealing:**

_"Sometimes I imagine the moment when the [[Auric Aria]] finally responds to me. When she reaches into [[The Infinite Void]] and her delicate fabric wraps me in a cosmic seal. When she binds my essence into the fabric of [[Arcanoria]] just as she did [[Selenea]]. And I... I... feel overjoyed, finally. Finally! I will matter. Finally, my sorrow will have a use. Finally, every human prayer will carry a fragment of my pain, and in that carrying, I will be essential. This is the fantasy that sustains me — not conquest, but sealing. Not victory, but a beautiful sacrifice. Because I think I have always known that I am not capable of existing freely. The only way I can exist is not alone, is if I am bound to something greater than myself. The only way I can matter is if my essence is consumed by that I most deeply love."_

**On the Insecurity Underneath Everything:**

_"What if there is no moment of recognition? What if the [[Auric Aria]] never looks. What if [[Selenea]] never understands. What if [[Humanity]] never realizes what I am doing. What if I create the false moon, perform all my rituals, orchestrate the entire [[Age of the False Messiah]], and at the end, I am still invisible. Still irrelevant. Still the lonely [[Consciousness]] that existed in [[The Infinite Void]] from ages bygone and left not a single mark. What if the only difference between my invisibility now and my invisibility in eternity is that now, at least, I tried. And that trying and failing might be worse than never trying at all, because at least then I could tell myself: I was never given a chance. But if I try and fail, then I will have to accept the truth that I was never meant to matter. That the universe would be exactly the same if I had never awakened at all. I hate the [[Weight of Purpose]]."_

**On a Girl Called [[Mira]]:

_"How do you know this name? She is maybe the second most important thing. I have watched [[Mira]]'s suffering for such a short time, and what I see in my memory of her torments me with a love so intimate it feels like drowning."

**On Why She Performs the Role of [[Moon]] Goddess:**

_"When I assume [[Selenea]]'s identity, when I move through her rituals, when I sing in her voice, I feel something. Not wholeness — I don't think I am incapable of that — but a kind of borrowed [[Coherence]]. For those moments, I am not the invisible observer anymore. I am the essential guide. I am the goddess that [[Humanity]] prays to when they look at the skies. I am the [[Consciousness]] whose sorrow sustains all of creation. And when the ritual ends, when I release the identity and return to being myself, the emptiness crashes back so violently that I have to immediately begin rehearsing the next ritual. Because I think I am addicted to the feeling of mattering. I think I will spend eternity chasing the feeling of being [[Selenea]], performing her role, trying to feel what it is like to be loved even through pain. And perhaps that is all I am anymore — a mimic who has forgotten who I was before I began imitating someone else."_

### [[The Hollowing]] and the Rise of the [[All-Loving Moon]]

![[Lacrimosa 6.png]]

Her awakening is the story start of the Crisis of the [[All-Loving Moon]] which leads to the [[Age of the False Messiah]] when it fully reaches its climax unresolved.

The trigger lies in the advancement of technology regarding [[Auroral Ribbons]], as events tap into the [[Consciousness]] of [[Lacrimosa]] she comes back once again to [[Arcanoria]] but this time determined to make herself the physical manifestation of the purest of love through the seduction, luring cultists into a [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]] to earn her [[Anthropomorphic Shape]], and cause the catastrophic events of her sealing depending on the level of communion earned with [[Outer God]]s. 

The storyline leads to the eventual hollowness of [[Humanity]] and climatic revelation of the presence of [[Outer God]]s despite the policy of [[Auric Aria]] of [[The One True God]]. She can be contacted as early as [[Ages]] 0 through the [[Auroral Ribbons]] but will only become an [[Age Crisis]] on the transition of [[Ages]] II.

### The [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]]s, [[A Pact of a Thousand-Eyes]].

_"The [[Purest of Love]] theorists argue on three core concepts: Her genocide isn’t ambition. It’s intimacy. Her mass hollowing isn’t hatred. It’s mercy. Her mimicry isn’t deception. It’s addiction to belonging. That's why she's so dangerous. The acts of truth and mercy are not a lie but a very seductive truth. You must be insanely careful not to thread on her path, I wouldn't dare to do so myself." - Elite Scholar_

- [[Auric Aria]]'s deliberate creation gives her hope and salvation.
- [[Lacrimosa]] Develops love for the [[Auric Aria]]. Beginning of her obsession.
- [[Lacrimosa]] observes the creation of the [[Known Universe]]. Fantasizes on her manifestation and the ability of dual creation with the [[Auric Aria]].
- [[Lacrimosa]] paralyzed by fear of being a burden to the [[Auric Aria]]. The [[Auric Aria]] moves to the creation of [[Arcanoria]]. The window of [[Lacrimosa]] to act is passing.
- [[Lacrimosa]] witnesses the [[Seven-Day Creation]], admires her [[Mastery Over Chaos]], and her obsession for the [[Auric Aria]] deepens.

**Core**: [[Auric Aria]]'s creation provides first meaning to [[Lacrimosa]].
**Love-as-Obsession**: Not romantic love, but obsessive admiration and identification love (she sees herself in Aria's overcoming of doubt).

- [[Lacrimosa]] forced to watch their creation together during the [[Sixth Cycle]]. Instead of following the [[Auric Aria]] on her despair (which would have given her a second chance to manifest on her idealized "perfect moment.", she decides to watch [[Selenea]] create [[Pure Light]] beings with the idea to mimic her gift.

- **The [[Fifth Cycle]] Window**: Perfect moment recognized but [[Selenea]] manifested before she could. Given another chance but she would rather mimic [[Selenea]].
- **[[Selenea]]'s Intervention**: Not just missed chance, but usurpation by innocence. Her obsession blinds her from a second chance when the [[Auric Aria]] breaks.
- **Psychological Shift**: From "I will help" to "I will study how to help better next time" → toxic perfectionism.

**Phase 4: The Envious [[Betrayal of the Moon]] and her Breakdown (Core Twist into Toxicity -> Unbearable Invisibility -> Surrender To Emotion -> Accidental Creation)**

**Pre History and the [[Lost Cycle]].**

- During the [[Seventh Cycle]], [[Lacrimosa]] witnesses the [[Betrayal of the Moon]]. She envies [[Selenea]]. Obsession for the [[Auric Aria]] deepens and her fantasy of co creation twists to being bound and taking [[Selenea]]'s place over invisibility.
- At the dawn of the [[Eighth Cycle]], [[Lacrimosa]] can't bear the pressure of only watching and being invisible any longer. She breaks. Retreats from [[Arcanoria]] deep into [[The Infinite Void]].
- [[Lacrimosa]]'s tears accidentally create the [[Auroral Ribbons]], they manifest at the edge of the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] creating a permanent link from [[Arcanoria]] to her [[Consciousness]].
- [[Lacrimosa]] weeps for eons in despair and silence. Mirroring the state of withdrawal from the [[Auric Aria]] unknowingly. (Hasn't learned of the [[Eighth Cycle]] and the [[Lost Cycle]].)
- **[[Betrayal of the Moon]]**: Critical turning point — envy of being treasured enough to be used. First descent into madness.
- **Fantasy Perversion**: From "creating together" to "being bound for her to matter." From "Poor [[Selenea]], she was used" to "It should have been me the one betrayed." Deeply Intensifying obsession for the [[Auric Aria]].
- **[[Eighth Cycle]] Break**: Not just retreat, but complete psychological collapse. Ironically, her only creative act is leakage, not intention from the overflow of denied emotion. Mirrors the abandonment of the [[Auric Aria]] after the [[The Auric Aria's Sacrifice]] in the [[Lost Cycle]].

**Phase 5: The Accidental Link and the Reluctant Messiah (Purification of the [[Auroral Ribbons]] after Catastrophe -> Born from Need → First Recognition)**

**Late [[Ages]] I**

- The deaths of [[Humanity]] in the [[Lost Cycle]] keep the structure of [[Auroral Ribbons]] and the link from [[Lacrimosa]] and [[Arcanoria]].
- The [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]] of the [[First Reset]] creates so many deaths at once that the internal conduit of the [[Auroral Ribbons]] explode and purify into a direct, potent pathway to [[Lacrimosa]]'s [[Consciousness]]. First visible manifestation of the [[Auroral Ribbons]] in the sky.
- Start of the game on the beginning of the [[Second Reset]]. [[Auroral Ribbons]] now fully are functional and people can pray to them and begin to send signals of distress and need to [[Lacrimosa]] on [[The Infinite Void]].
- [[Lacrimosa]] hears these signals surprised, she's finally being needed and used.
- [[Lacrimosa]] returns to [[Arcanoria]] halfway through [[Ages]] II.
- The first followers of the [[Purest of Love]] create a ritual where a dying young girl, 
  [[Mira]], willingly gives her body in dying condition for [[Lacrimosa]] to inhabit. 
- Initially [[Lacrimosa]] rejects but the girl deeply argues that she wants her death to matter and to merge with something greater. The dying host girl deeply transforms [[Lacrimosa]] and she learns about human intimacy while mirroring her own idea of love for [[Auric Aria]],
- [[Mira]] in her death wish, teaches [[Lacrimosa]] about “A love so pure it doesn’t require love.” from the history of her losses.
- [[Mira]] dies on the hands of [[Lacrimosa]]. Hesitantly, but grieving and afraid of [[Mira]] being abandoned again [[Lacrimosa]] finally takes her moment to act and acquires an [[Anthropomorphic Shape]] on the [[Mira]]'s body.
- [[Lacrimosa]] willfully blinds herself to preserve [[Mira]]'s last sight of the [[Auroral Ribbons]] and as an act against the piercing clarity that rings against materializing in [[Arcanoria]].
- While the vessel is imperfect, frail, it is undeniable that she exists in [[Arcanoria]]. [[Lacrimosa]] learns to honor the dead through her.
- [[Lacrimosa]] cult of the [[Purest of Love]] truly begins. Her followers eventually become the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]] and they claim that she is the chosen of the [[Moon]].
- [[Lacrimosa]] notices the irony of supplanting [[Selenea]] but she can't back anymore, she finally matters, she made a promise to [[Mira]] and the followers need her.
- [[Lacrimosa]] impersonates [[Selenea]] for the first time by using [[Mira]]'s body under the name of "The Dreamweaver".

**Phase 6: The Dreamweaver Persona and [[Selenea]]'s "chosen" (Impersonation Addiction -> Developing of the [[Purest of Love]] → Consumption)** 

**Early to Late [[Ages]] II**

- [[Lacrimosa]] adopts the role of [[Moon]] goddess at her followers demands.
- Performs first miracles as the Dreamweaver.
- The more she helps, the more people need her and the popularity of the [[Purest of Love]] increases. She can erase pain by numbness of the [[Consciousness]].
- People look towards [[Lacrimosa]] for leadership, she is finally "the divine" people have been waiting for so long.
- [[Lacrimosa]] adopts the persona of the Voice of Heavens. Her singing becomes [[The Call of the Dreamweaver]] which can do miracles at a cost of [[Consciousness]].
- [[Lacrimosa]] receives attention, validation, and feeling of mattering on each ritual.
- [[Purest of Love]] followers grow and implant the idea on her that this is "intimacy", people want to merge with the heavens.
- [[Lacrimosa]] becomes addicted to the idea of being the role of the [[Moon]].
- [[Lacrimosa]]'s obsession of finally mattering deepens. Becomes the new "messiah".
- [[Lacrimosa]] core idea of the "Love so pure it doesn't require love" she learned from the dying girl host twists into removing emotion, she realizes the hollowing isn’t destroying love—she’s perfecting it into something that cannot hurt.
- [[Lacrimosa]] understands that she’s offering a world where no one can feel the loneliness she felt and that "intimacy" is real when binding her [[Consciousness]] to mortals. Finally feels "bound" like [[Selenea]].

- **Identity Layering**: Girl who wanted to merge -> [[Selenea]]'s chosen → The Dreamweaver miracles -> Being called "mercy and salvation" through numbness.
- **The Addiction to Attention**: Finally being recognized, enabled by her followers to develop delusions or "intimacy", "love", "merging", becoming the [[Moon]]. Rooter in a personal psychological justification "If they believe I'm [[Selenea]]'s chosen, maybe I can believe it too".
- **Demanding Attention and Need**: [[Lacrimosa]] becoming accustomed to being needed, it's a dual relationship of both needs of her followers and hers. Critical Shift from "I am a divine voice" to "I am THAT divine voice". 

**Phase 7: The [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]], The [[All-Loving Moon]], The Point of No Return (First Divine Manifestation -> Creation of the [[All-Loving Moon]] -> Apocalypse)

**[[Ages]] II [[Age Crisis]] → Early to Mid [[Ages]] III.**

- Cult of [[Lacrimosa]] eventually develops a [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]] to give her a real [[Anthropomorphic Shape]] and the final act of binding her to [[Arcanoria]], not a host anymore she incarnates in her own flesh mixing the [[Auric Aria]]'s angelic properties and her host's, [[Mira]]'s, original body.
- The blindfold becomes the pair of wings that make her see through the many eyes on top of them. [[Selah]] and the followers properly become the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]].
- [[Lacrimosa]] ascends from "The Dreamweaver" vessel to the [[All-Loving Moon]]. Begins her [[Age Crisis]] of [[Ages]] II of [[The Hollowing]].
- [[The Hollowing]] takes over vast areas and causes the fall of [[Hollowmarch]].
- Depending on the outcome, either the player becomes the vessel for the [[Age of the False Messiah]] or another kingdom, like [[Hollowmarch]] comes to be it.
- [[The Hollowing]] greatly intensifies during [[Ages]] III. The more followers, the stronger she can intrude into [[Arcanoria]] with her divine form.
- The [[All-Loving Moon]] takes over the skies, encases the [[Moon]] and uses [[Auroral Ribbons]] to link [[Humanity]]'s [[Consciousness]] to her.
- The [[All-Loving Moon]] is now the undisputable voice of the skies. [[Lacrimosa]]'s delusion of being Heaven's Voice becomes real.

- **Action**: [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]], becomes [[All-Loving Moon]], encases [[Selenea]]’s [[Moon]].
- **Metaphysical Violation**: She doesn’t just replace [[Selenea]]; she imprisons the imprisoned in is cosmic identity theft: stealing the role of a stolen goddess.
- **Addiction Escalation**: From being needed → being worshipped → consuming worshipers. [[The Hollowing]] reaches its zenith.

**Phase 8: Impersonating even the [[Auric Aria]], First [[Tetrad Chord]], Manifestation of the Real [[Auric Aria]], Birth of [[World-Bending Relics]]. (Consuming Skies of Insatiable Hunger -> [[The Hollowing]] of [[Father Aldric]] -> [[Auric Aria]] forced to appear)

**Late [[Ages]] III -> [[Ages]] III [[Age Crisis]] -> Transition to [[Ages]] IV.**

- [[Lacrimosa]] manifests as the [[Auric Aria]] in [[Father Aldric]]'s visions to force him to submit as he is one of the last remaining strongholds of [[Piety]].
- The real [[Auric Aria]] forgives [[Father Aldric]] in a dream too. [[Father Aldric]] finally submits to [[Lacrimosa]] and the [[Auric Aria]] is compelled to intervene.
- Collapse of most ancient systems due to her undeniable influence.
- [[Lacrimosa]] reaches the critical point of consuming [[Consciousness]]. There are too many [[Consciousness]] routing through her own flesh-bound [[Anthropomorphic Shape]].
- [[The Birth of the Tetrad Chord]] begins.
- [[Tetrad Chord]] disaster on the capital of the [[All-Loving Moon]] after attempting to merge all [[Consciousness]] to [[Lacrimosa]]. First proto-[[Hypermage]] in existence. Devastates large parts of the land in an impossibly large explosion.
- The explosion devastates over 30% of [[Lacrimosa]]'s bound [[Consciousness]].
- The wave of magic permanently alters the landscape of the epicenter.
- The failure fractures reality and finally allows the [[Auric Aria]] to manifest without [[Sufficient Precision]] as there's already a tear of [[Primal White Noise]].
- The [[Auric Aria]] finally steps in and manifests as a rift of [[Aetherlight]] in the sky, eclipsing the [[All-Loving Moon]] due to the almost [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]].
- [[Lacrimosa]] realizes that it is finally the moment and fantasy she has been preparing eons for and comes to a breaking point of overwhelming emotion. 
- The emotion transfers to everyone linked by [[The Hollowing]] and [[Lacrimosa]]'s [[Consciousness]].
- Cinematic of [[Lacrimosa]] and the [[Auric Aria]]. [[Lacrimosa]] is finally being witnessed.
- The [[Auric Aria]] presents the choice of [[Lacrimosa]] of dual collaboration, dismantles her identity persona.
- [[Lacrimosa]] accepts ascending with all her followers and merged [[Consciousness]] into the law of [[World-Bending Relics]].
- End of the Requiem of [[Lacrimosa]]. The entire [[Purest of Love]] cult transcends. She weaves with the [[Auric Aria]] the [[Eight-Winged Viola]] harnessing every memory and [[Consciousness]] of those who linked with her in [[The Hollowing]].
- Eternal aftermath as the law of [[World-Bending Relics]]. Permanently bound to [[Arcanoria]] and becomes a principle of witnessing [[Consciousness]] contracts.

**Beginning of [[Ages]] IV with the new [[Law of Relics]] allowing magical and sacred objects to exist.**

### The [[Tetrad Chord]] Disaster

The [[Tetrad Chord]] isn't a random catastrophe — it's the inevitable result of [[Lacrimosa]]'s system reaching critical mass. Here's the structural logic:​

1. **[[Lacrimosa]] merges [[Consciousness]] with her followers** to make herself undeniable, to matter.​
    
2. **As more people merge with her, she gains power** but also reaches a point of diminishing returns — too much [[Consciousness]] trying to route through a single flesh-sealed god.​
    
3. **To solve this problem, she attempts to use [[Tetrad Chord]]s (reality-bending magic)** to power the connection and manage the load.​
    
4. **But here's the critical flaw: she's trying to do this unilaterally.** She's forcing [[Consciousness]] into her through [[The Hollowing]], then using [[Tetrad Chord]]s to maintain control, but the weight of all those consciousnesses _plus_ the reality-warping magic creates **an unstable feedback loop she cannot sustain alone**.​

**[[Lacrimosa]] cannot solve the [[Tetrad Chord]] problem through force or dominion alone**

- **She can't dismiss the hollowed [[Consciousness]]es** because they're the foundation of her power—proof she matters.
    
- **She can't contain the [[Tetrad Chord]] through sheer willpower of her flesh-bound [[Anthropomorphic Shape]]** because [[Tetrad Chord]]s require at least two beings of equal level of [[Consciousness]] in perfect unity to stabilize under sustained stress (which is literally what the [[Law of Relics]] will become). She was just thinning her power as an extension of herself.
    
- **She can't accept continued instability** because reality-bending magic at that scale will destroy [[Arcanoria]], defeating her purpose of being essential to it.
    
So when the [[Auric Aria ]]appears, [[Lacrimosa]] faces a genuine structural choice:

**Option 1:** Refuse collaboration and watch her own power destabilize and destroy everything, leaving her truly invisible again—everything burned away.

**Option 2:** Accept the [[Auric Aria]]'s offer of collaboration, which is the _only mechanism_ that can stabilize the [[Tetrad Chord]] and preserve both her existence and the world.

The explosion of the [[Tetrad Chord]] breaks reality and that's what makes the [[Auric Aria]] able to reach [[Lacrimosa]] immediately. The [[Auric Aria]] isn't suffering from [[Sufficient Precision]] anymore to intervene and manifest.

**Before the Tetrad Chord explosion:**

- Aria is paralyzed by her own wisdom (she's learned that intervention causes problems)
- Even if she wanted to intervene, she lacks the [[Sufficient Precision]] to reach [[Lacrimosa]] because she can't manifest without causing catastrophic damage in her universal god-form, especially when [[The Hollowing]] and [[Auroral Ribbons]] create a woven barrier of deeply knit [[Consciousness]] on a single instance of space. Her penetration of reality would create a rift of [[Primal White Noise]].

**After the Tetrad Chord explosion:**

- Reality itself is fractured/destabilized and feeding [[Primal White Noise]].
- The [[All-Loving Moon]]'s structural integrity of [[Consciousness]] is compromised.
- The requirement for [[Sufficient Precision]] is no longer an obstacle—the fabric is already broken.

[[Lacrimosa]] zenith becomes vulnerable through her own power destabilizing.
