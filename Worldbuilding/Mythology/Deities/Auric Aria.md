### Characterization & Quotes


**On the Formless Masses: The Children She Cannot Acknowledge

_"They are me, or well "me" in a sense? Every twisted, screaming, half-made [[Consciousness]] is a piece of my doubt in a horrible materialized form. I created them by accident and desperately came to the first revelation to my innate lack of power or well, [[Sufficient Precision]], on the very same laws I created. For a while, I pretended they were not my fault. I blamed the nature of creation, the inherent imperfection of weaving something that has a [[Consciousness]] too in the chaos of existence. But they are my children, just as much as [[Humanity]] is my child—perhaps more so, because they are the only thing I ever created without trying to control what they would become, or maybe it is because I cared too much about what they would be. I guess they are the most authentic expression of myself in the entire cosmos. And I have spent every age since their birth trying to erase them, or hide from them, or build systems to keep them imprisoned. What does that say about what I think of myself?"**_
