*"A Hymn Woven in the Threads of both Gold and Shadow."

Before existence, before matter, before even gods, there was nothing, and before there was nothing, there was the [[The Eternal Symphony]], an infinite expanse of silent potential. It was not yet sound, not yet matter — only unending, absolute silence. It was a thread not yet plucked, an instrument with latent [[Potential of Creation]], containing all that could be, yet nothing had form, shape, or consciousness. [[The Eternal Symphony]] was preexistent beyond time, yet a blank canvas for all of creation to awaken.

In a single instant of causality, from this silence, the [[Original Ripple]] arose: [[The First Overtone]], a singular vibration of [[Flux]] that awakened [[The Infinite Void]] to [[Primal White Noise]]. For the first time, existence could hear [[The Eternal Symphony]], if only in potential, stirring the cosmos into motion and laying the seed of rhythm that would, one day, govern creation.

The first vibrations of this [[Primal White Noise]]  flickered consciousness, dim sparks of existence across [[The Infinite Void]] — awareness without form, gods not yet born, and beings without shape. They moved and whispered in [[The Infinite Void]], attempting to bend chaos to their wills, shaping ephemeral threads into fleeting forms. Their experiments with creation were tentative and brief, their efforts beautiful but unanchored, dissolving as soon as they themselves appeared.

After countless Eons, the thread vibrations calmed, and amid this restless sea of proto-awareness, a singular consciousness achieved complete self-awareness: the [[Auric Aria]]. Unlike the flickering proto-beings, she had stable thought, reflection, and intention. Alone in the chaos, she perceived the [[Potential of Creation]] of [[The Eternal Symphony]] and [[The First Overtone]], saw both the possibilities and the fleeting creations of the nascent [[Outer God]]s. At first, she marveled at them, but soon a seed of jealousy took root in her mind. Why should these other beings shape existence while she remained absent in the works of the cosmos?

Born from this jealousy and desire to assert her will, the [[Auric Aria]] began her first act of deliberate creation, the [[Known Universe]]. She wove from chaos and [[Flux ]]the [[Auric Heptacode]], the law of matter, space, and structure, giving stability to the formless vibrations, shaping physicality into stardust and energy itself. The [[Auric Heptacode]] became the lattice of seven golden threads that bound the raw vibrations of the cosmos into order, a structure to persist long after her immediate presence. It was progress, but she did not stop there. She shaped the [[Trinity Harmony]], time itself bound to a threefold law of past, present, and future. It was a flowing continuum that established memory, causality, and destiny. The [[Known Universe]] now had a rhythm, a framework in which actions, choices, and consequences could unfold, a place where [[The Eternal Symphony]] could sing with the first patterns of order.

With the [[Auric Heptacode]] and the [[Trinity Harmony]] in place, the [[Auric Aria]] wove stars into constellations and the nebulae into cosmic seas, forming the [[Proto-Universe]]. [[Outer God]]s observed and continued their experiments with raw chaos in [[The Infinite Void]], yet the [[Auric Aria]] weaving was deliberate, harmonized with the [[The Eternal Symphony]] itself. Her jealousy lingered, for the other creations reminded her of her solitude. She saw the [[Potential of Creation]], yet no world reflected the totality of her will. Her works were beautiful, mesmerizing, and disconnected from herself. It was then that she resolved to create something not just permanent, but unique and in her image.

From this determination, the [[Auric Aria]] began the [[Seven-Day Creation]] of [[Arcanoria]]. She envisioned it as a realm of ordered matter and magic, designed not merely as another celestial object in the cosmos but as a recipient and statement of her [[Mastery Over Chaos]].

On the [[First Cycle]], she shaped the crust, the land, the seas, and the skies, giving the realm tangible form. Building upon the land's shaping, on the [[Second Cycle]], she wove the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] — the magical network that binds every vibration through a vast web — alongside the [[Leylines]], flowing as the [[Symphonic Veins]] of the world that carry the lifeblood and [[Resonance]] of [[The Eternal Symphony]] itself. On the [[Third Cycle]], mountains, plains, and rivers arose, sculpted as relief from the threads of the [[Auric Heptacode]]. On the [[Fourth Cycle]], she harmonized the rhythm of [[The First Overtone]] with [[Arcanoria]] and the celestial bodies, binding the stars into a symphony of [[Cosmic Motion]].

As perfect as everything seemed, the [[Fifth Cycle]] revealed the [[Auric Aria]]'s first major flaw. She attempted the [[First Weaving of Life]]. She decided to use threads of the [[Great Harmonic Loom]], to weave creatures that mimicked the world, beings of air, water, fire, and earth. Yet every time she plucked a new strand, a growing dread, rooted in her, fractured her focus. A visceral fear that her masterpiece, [[Arcanoria]], would remain imperfect, chaotic as [[The Infinite Void]] that first gave her existence.

This dread grew into her weave, costing her [[Absolute Certainty]]. She placed the threads incorrectly, and as a result, the very thing she had wanted to avoid came to pass. The forms flickered, not merely lacking cohesion, but infected by her own despairing hesitation. They were a note played with a trembling heart, fragile, dissonant. They collapsed into the earth, as agonizing shadows of fractured creation, screaming inwardly against their own half-made existence as [[Formless Masses]], twisted, decaying, and irreducible clots of divine doubt.

That was the original [[Dissonance]], one wrong note played not from lack of skill, but from anxiety and doubt. And from this first fundamental failure of emotion, from this fatal failure, the violence and cruelty of the natural world were born — the need for predation, survival, and the [[Inevitability of Death]]. The [[Auric Aria]], horrified at what she had wrought, attempted to undo her creations, but her control lacked the [[Sufficient Precision]] — the art of threading a point of thought in a singular, crystal-clear intent — to disperse the woven threads. The [[Formless Masses]] persisted, embedded into [[Arcanoria]]'s very fabric, seeding a [[Corruption]] she could not eradicate and birthing the first [[Primal Discordia]]. A hollow, hungry essence that was fear given form.

It was at the end of the [[Fifth Cycle]] that [[Selenea]] manifested into the reality of the [[Auric Aria]]. A formless, pale [[Outer God]] who had observed the [[Auric Aria]] efforts from [[The Infinite Void]] from [[Cycle]]s past, she was drawn by admiration for the [[Auric Aria]] [[Mastery Over Chaos]]. [[Selenea]]'s desire to assist was born not of envy but of innocent awe — she wished only to nurture and bring life to the world that the [[Auric Aria]] had shaped. Using her own essence, [[Selenea]] breathed vitality into the [[First Living Being]]: a [[Fated Flower]], perfectly formed, golden and vibrant, in [[Resonance]] with life. Witnessing this [[Perfect Manifestation of Life]], [[Auric Aria]] gazed in astonishment — the potential she had always imagined became now tangible. [[Selenea]]'s ability allowed creations to have a unique [[Fundamental Frequency]], the unique vibration of the soul that grants identity to all existence. Thus, reluctantly, and out of necessity, she permitted [[Selenea]] to aid her work, though a seed of jealousy and possessiveness began to grow within her.

On the [[Sixth Cycle]], the two worked together. The [[Auric Aria]] wove the physical structure from the [[Auric Heptacode]]; she gave flesh, wings, fins, and claws. [[Selenea]] infused the husk of these forms; she breathed them with vitality and a [[Fundamental Frequency]]. Thus, together in [[Consonance]], they gave birth to a myriad of life. It shaped the landscape across the skies, seas, and soil. Yet even as life blossomed, remnants of the [[Formless Masses]] invaded. Some of the newborn creatures were subject to the [[Corruption]], warping them into predators, abominations, and vessels of suffering in a cruel reflection of life's [[Potential of Creation]]. 

Halfway through the [[Sixth Cycle]], the [[Auric Aria]]'s heart could bear no more. She witnessed in horror as her creations were killed, devoured, or corrupted by the lingering [[Formless Masses]]. She watched as these beings perished, prey and predator alike, and despair gripped her. Empathetic and broken, she withdrew and isolated herself. Depressed and questioning her power, her will, her existence, and the limitations of the [[Sufficient Precision]] to weave, even for a god. [[Selenea]], however, remained, continuing her work alone. She created beings of [[Pure Light]], formless yet radiant, beings without structure, as only the [[Auric Aria]] could weave tangible form. She labored patiently, awaiting the [[Auric Aria]]'s return, nurturing [[Pure Light]] where the [[Auric Aria]]'s hands had stuttered.

In her profound isolation, the [[Auric Aria]] concluded after reflecting on the despair of witnessing life's cruelty and imperfection. She had to give life to a creation that would fully embody her essence. It would need to be coherent, gifted in sentience, and attuned solely to her [[Fundamental Frequency]] — something she could call her own, a [[Perfect Reflection]] of herself. Thus, in this pensive state at the end of the [[Sixth Cycle]], the idea of [[Humanity]] emerged — beings that would be her crowned and ultimate creation, a [[Perfect Reflection]] of her will, attuned to both her form and her [[Resonance]], yet inherently alive through [[Selenea]]'s unique gift of vitality.

The [[Seventh Cycle]] dawned with renewed purpose, though shadowed by the [[Auric Aria]] lingering despair. The thought of [[Humanity]] — attuned to her essence in a [[Perfect Reflection]] of her will — consumed her mind. She knew that the [[Seventh Cycle]] carried a special gravity, for within the [[Auric Heptacode]] the [[Seventh]] thread resonated as the one with most [[Consonance]], the one that could bind all others in unison. It was the sacred number of completion, the [[Cycle]] destined to crown creation itself. 

With resolve and veiled intent, she approached [[Selenea]]. Together, they willed to shape shaping a being unlike any other, one that could harmonize with the [[Potential of Creation]]. In innocent eagerness, unaware of the jealousy coiled in the [[Auric Aria]] heart, [[Selenea]] envisioned creatures similar to those of [[Pure Light]] interwoven yet enhanced by form, both radiant and enduring — a union of their gifts. But as the [[Cycle]] progressed, the [[Auric Aria]]'s despair deepened. She could not forget the cruelty of the [[Formless Masses]], nor the [[Corruption]] they sowed in her earlier works. She knew, dreadfully confident, that if she made [[Humanity]] through collaboration, they would never be hers alone, never in [[Perfect Reflection]]. They would always carry [[Selenea]]'s touch and her [[Fundamental Frequency]], just as the birds and beasts did. 

The thought alone poisoned her. Envy, cold and sharp, coiled around her heart. For all her [[Mastery Over Chaos]], would prove nothing if she shared her [[Perfect Reflection]], it would not be the [[Perfect Manifestation of Life]] she solely envisioned and [[Pure Light]] was harder to attune to her [[Fundamental Frequency]] alone, as it had entirely the essence of [[Selenea]]. Thus, she devised a unique [[Celestial Ensnaring Mirror]], a perfect trap in the night sky, conjured from the powerful emotion she felt, rooted in fear for her faltering hand at the original [[Dissonance]], and fueled by [[Absolute Certainty]] of her desire. It was forged uniquely in [[Cosmic Motion]] from direct threads of [[The First Overtone]], able to give form to any [[Fundamental Frequency]], able to give form even to the formless. It was, in its very essence, envy and fear made manifest in a cosmic, subduing obelisk.

As such, when the time came, she praised [[Selenea]]'s efforts and lured her into weaving her concentrated essence into the framework of their next creation. It was then, with a single, devastating motion, that the [[Auric Aria]] sealed [[Selenea]] into the [[Moon]], giving her a bounded form and seeping her vitality through the [[Leylines]] of [[Arcanoria]]. And it was from the very chains of her confinement that bled a substance anew, [[Emberwhisper]], velvet crystals that gleamed a deep crimson and carried the hush of a thousand sorrows. They were the crystallized essence of theft itself, forged from the crime of binding that gave life to the world.

From this betrayal, the [[Auric Aria]] at last claimed the missing spark for herself. With [[Selenea]]'s stolen gift, she wove [[Humanity]], beings in her own image: upright, sentient, resonant with thoughts, will, memory, and, most importantly, a [[Perfect Reflection]] of her own [[Fundamental Frequency]]. Unlike the beasts, they were not bound solely by instinct or to the cruelty of nature; unlike [[Pure Light]] beings, they had tangible flesh and enduring form; unlike anything before, they did not suffer to the same extent of the [[Inevitability of Death]] as every other living being that clung to life from instinct. [[Humanity]] was her ultimate creation, her [[Perfect Reflection]], and her crown.

At last came the [[Eighth Cycle]], forbidden, taboo, and unspoken. For in that [[Cycle]] the [[Auric Aria]] clothed herself in flesh, weaving skin and bone from her own radiant thread. She descended into [[Arcanoria]] as a weaver turned mortal.

Her first steps trembled with awe. What she had long shaped as design, she now felt with breath and blood. The forest did not answer to her command, nor rise to pattern, but instead stood as a living cathedral. Branches arched like vaulted halls of golden leaves, rivers coursed with silvered music, and the wind trembled with rhythms she had never written. She walked not as a creator, but as a witness. Her heart swelled with amazement: what she had woven was like herself, alive, and more beautiful than she ever dared to imagine. The world sang in a unique harmony, in a song that reflected her own [[Fundamental Frequency]], yet somehow strange and unfamiliar. 

At the bank of a river, jeweled with moonlight, she saw fruit dangling from a low-hung bough — pale gold, glowing faintly in the silvered beams. Compelled, she plucked it and bit it. It was sweet, but the juice scorched like fire in her veins. In a flash, she felt the weight of mortality, of thirst, of hunger, its vulnerability and ache. Her heartbeat quivered; she breathed, and for the first time, she knew fragility, a forbidden flavor from the fruit, of both a revelation and a curse.

Beside her, a creature drank from the same stream the tree had grown — small, horned, gentle, radiant in innocence. Drawn by her newfound empathy, she touched its flank. Delicate as a single thread in the vast loom, the warmth of its [[Fundamental Frequency]] dimly hummed through her fingers. It whispered praise, and she marveled, for it was a [[Perfect Manifestation of Life]] she could now feel. The [[Auric Aria]] and the beast shared [[Resonance]], even if for one ephemeral moment, attuning to the hymn of the world.

But the shadow broke the song. From beneath the trees, a [[Primal Discordia]] — faceless, hollow, coiled like a serpent — struck swift and merciless. It tore the creature from existence in a single, terrible motion. Blood stained the stream, tainting the silver river red as the beast fell lifeless at her side. Horror seized the [[Auric Aria]]. She felt the [[Inevitability of Death]], as a sharp, searing reality — she felt it, smelled it, trembled before it. The [[Primal Discordia]] devoured its kill, then turned upon her. Large, black claws pierced her side, and a burst, like that of molten iron, tore through her flesh. She felt pain and fear for the first time.

She fled. She stumbled through root and thorn, each breath a chorus of panic. She ran until her legs could give in no longer. She ran until her body, spun from auric thread, yet new to the scourge of mortality, failed. At last, she collapsed in a meadow, breathing shallow, in limbs trembling, her [[Golden Ichor]] mixing with the soil.

It was here that a band of villagers picking berries discovered she had passed out. They were not hunters, nor rulers, but humble mortals of the earth. They found her fragile body as one might a fallen bird, unsure whether to cradle or flee. Some shrank in fear, whispering that she was no woman, but a spirit in borrowed flesh. Yet others, moved by pity and awe, laid trembling hands upon her wounds. In that touch, [[Resonance]] stirred — faint, luminous, undeniable. Her suffering became a spark, and within their souls the first chords of magic awakened from this emotion. The song of the world had now found human voices.

They carried her back to their settlement. At first, the gates opened wide in hurried hope, with some villagers rushing to treat her wounds. But as her [[Golden Ichor]] bled from her side into the earth, it shimmered, it whispered, and a hush fell. All eyes widened. The uncanny glow traced her shape, and awe turned quickly to unease. Their hearts sensed an otherness, a whispered truth unspoken but deeply felt: she was something apart, walking in flesh borrowed, not truly her own.

Some still pressed closer, hands steadfast to bind her wounds, murmuring a humming of comfort. In that trembling communion, a subtle chord vibrated through the air — the first [[Attunement for Magic]], faint yet powerful. From sorrow and compassion, the spark of magic kindled in intention and human emotion. The air seemed to hum as the world's song threaded through mortal voices for the first time, a melody born of pain and wonder alike that sealed the bleeding.

Fear, however, is a sharper chord than wonder. The [[Dissonance]] she had first seeded into the world during the [[Fifth Cycle]] — that original, trembling note of divine fear — now found its echo in the hearts of [[Humanity]]. Murmurs became cries; eyes that had softened now widened in terror. The elders, sensing power beyond comprehension above the golden stains, called her a curse incarnate. Shadows, they said, clung to her as surely as the wound to her flesh. Whispers became judgment, and judgment became a threat. Her life was met, not with understanding, but with imprisonment. They sought to sever the dissonant note, unaware that they were repeating the very first fatal flaw of their creator. And so, she was tried for execution. She did not resent, as she knew intimately, for it was a reflection of her own.

As night came, those who had felt her [[Resonance]], and with it the faint pulse of [[The Eternal Symphony]] in their veins, could not allow this. They sought her beneath the veil of night, carrying her away from gates that had first opened in hope. And so, she fled once more. Each step was heavy with the knowledge of her own fragility, the imperfection in her weaving, and the realization that even her stolen gift bore the [[Weight of Flaw]].

Alone and tattered, her steps carried her to a high cliff, moonlit and windswept. She reached a circular clearing overgrown on a crescent field of [[Fated Flower]]s — the first [[Perfect Manifestation of Life]] that proved her vision true, one that with [[Selenea]] she had created together. The field was calm, a place where not even the wind dared to stir; the breeze was almost absent, as if the world itself anticipated muted.

Below, the vast ocean sang an endless hymn. The [[Leylines]] shimmered like silver threads all through the land. The [[Moon]], bound with the essence of [[Selenea]], cast its reflection across the sea, and the [[Auric Aria]] beheld it — a mirror of the one she had ensnared. An [[Inescapable Truth]] struck with grief deeper than the wound in her side: the imperfection had not arisen from mortals, nor from the spirits that lurked, it wasn't from the slain creature that tainted the river red. It had come from her own hand, her own thread. Even the act of subduing [[Selenea]] could not erase the flaw embedded in her essence. What she had woven bore sorrow and violence, and she was powerless to change it.

And so, she chose to take her life. With a final breath in golden tears, she leaped into the ocean, far across the cliff. Her mortal frame shattered upon the waves, and her essence erupted in song, raw and unbound. The world trembled in [[Golden Ichor]]. From her spirit violently flowed [[Aetherlight]], the purified [[Resonance]] of her sorrow and radiance, and [[Moonshine]], the captured vitality of [[Selenea]]'s bound form, entwining in the [[Leylines]]. In its silvered currents, [[Selenea]]'s own longing and melancholy stirred dream-like visions in mortal sleepers — she glimpsed her lost creations, and they awoke with a yearning that carried her gift with them. Magic poured deeply into [[Arcanoria]], seeding the first instruments of power deep within the [[Great Harmonic Loom]], solidifying [[The Principles of Magic]]. Humans and beasts, spirits of light and shadow, all attuned to [[The Eternal Symphony]] for the first time. The place of [[The Auric Aria's Sacrifice]] became [[The Silent Expanse]], a wasteland of wild magic where no wind stirs, as if the world itself mourned the death of her mortal frame.

Upon the clearing made shrine, the [[Fated Flower]]s could not endure the direct [[Resonance]] of her sorrow. Where her final tears had fallen, they darkened and decayed. Their vibrant gold bleeding into a deep, wounded crimson — the same terrible hue that had tainted the silver river from the first death she witnessed — transforming the clearing into the first field of [[Forsaken Flower]]s. And yet, from that very decay, a new life emerged from the silence: [[Glimmerfern]]. Its fronds, pale and delicate, were traced with veins of liquid silver mirroring that of [[Leylines]]. It glimmered softly and in unison, in deep blue, reminiscent of the moonlit ocean she had seen below. It was a quiet miracle — life born not of weaving, but of pure, undiluted emotion. It became a testament and a living memorial to the moment a god's heart broke not in rage, but in sorrowful understanding. It was the antithesis of the crimson [[Emberwhisper]]; where one was the crystal of theft, the other was the bloom of remorse.

For countless [[Cycle]]s, the [[Auric Aria]] withdrew into silence, slipping between form and thought — it came to be the [[Lost Cycle]]. Mortals stood alone in a godless world, learning to shape the mark she left behind. Even in the [[Auric Aria]]'s silence, they tuned their [[Fundamental Frequency]] and honed [[Sufficient Precision]], reaching her in quiet communion through distant dreams. For in the stillness, [[Selenea]]'s silvery whispers drifted from the [[Moon]], a hushed, desperate lament guiding those who still listened toward [[Consonance]]. Further above, unseen and immense, several [[Outer God]]s peered through the veil, hungering to claim the abandoned threads. Their forms were too vast to shape the mortal plane directly. They could only influence with [[Sufficient Precision]] through flesh-woven vessels, imperfect conduits of will. Valleys writhed beneath secret motions, forests muttered strange hymns, rivers ran blackened with echoes of desire, and the [[Primal Discordia]] danced through mortal lives. It was the darkest time for [[Humanity]], an age when extinction hung by a thread, and even hope itself seemed a vain, innocent dream.

After [[Ages]] of anguished supplication and sacrifices, of the first [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]], and of beseeching cries carried on the winds across a godforsaken land during the [[Lost Cycle]], the [[Auric Aria]] at last returned. Her arrival was not one of triumph, but relentless, drawn by the desperate pleading of the faint, clinging hope of survivors. Their generations of suffering rose as a chorus too visceral, impossible to ignore.

Aria, scarred yet unbroken, emerged from silence, peering at one of the many distress calls that bore her name. In a windless valley, she found a pilgrim — fatally wounded — hugging a pale sapling and clutching a vial of [[Selenea]]'s silvery moonlit whispers beneath a withered tree. Driven by desperation, the pilgrim lifted a brittle branch from the dying tree skyward. In a voice soft with empathy, the [[Auric Aria]] attuned herself to the dying sorrow. With impeccable precision, she wove that fragile hope into the pilgrim's soul, and when the pilgrim hugged the sapling again, its pale leaves unfurled, golden anew in vitality. In that moment, she understood what the passing of so many [[Cycle]]s had taught her in her stillness: she could not weave the [[Perfect Manifestation of Life]] alone. The physical threads were too thin and required the [[Sufficient Precision]] of weaving a singular thread, which she did not possess.

Yet she refused to abandon her crowned creation, [[Humanity]] carried within them her [[Fundamental Frequency]], and the pilgrim showed her that some even bore the thread capable of shaping harmony with care and the [[Absolute Certainty]] required in [[Perfect Reflection]]. Through them, she could channel [[The Eternal Symphony]] in the unbound [[Potential of Creation]] that no god could exert upon flesh directly. No longer a distant architect of perfection, she canonized herself through mortal agency as [[The One True God]], a guiding hand against the [[Outer God]]s, seeding fragments of her own consciousness as [[Piety]]. It was the first warmth, a luminous grace of the first motif in her melody, made vocal after [[Ages]] bygone speechless.

And so, [[Humanity]] became both her heirs and her instruments, tasked with continuing the pursuit of the [[Perfect Manifestation of Life]], carrying her essence in their voice.
