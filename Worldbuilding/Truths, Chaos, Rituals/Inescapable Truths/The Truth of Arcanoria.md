The [[Auric Aria]] narrates the [[True Mythos of Creation]] after the end of the [[Second Reset]] when the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]] of the [[Great Fracture]] ends [[Civilization]].

Having access to [[The Truth of Arcanoria]] unlocks a lot of content through the game, akin to entering Hard mode in Terraria. Knowing the [[The Truth of Arcanoria]] unlocks:

 - The real ending of the [[Polychord Crisis]], unlocking [[Ages]] VII onwards.
 - Special [[Ages]] like the [[Age of Hymns]].
 - The storyline of [[Selenea]], and the origin story of [[Lacrimosa]].
 - Many interactions with [[Lacrimosa]] during [[The Hollowing]].
 - Several storylines previously unknown.
 - Access to [[Fanatical]] government types.
 - Access to creating [[Crisis Wonders]], not just inheriting them.
 - Learning the origin of [[Crisis Wonders]] and having [[Mega Construction Wonders]] turn into [[Crisis Wonders]] for the next [[Civilization Reset]].
 - Interacting with the [[Auric Aria]] and determining her involvement in [[Civilization]].
 - The full potential of the [[Aureus Pillar]] through the interface of the [[Auric Aria]] and her incarnation.
 - The full potential of the [[Chorus Pillar]] communion and invoking [[Outer God]]s in [[Flesh-Binding Ritual]]s after [[The Hollowing]].
 - The [[Divine Reset]] menu for restarting civilization and the upgrade tree.
 - Interactions as a major [[Civilization]] for the first [[Ages]].
