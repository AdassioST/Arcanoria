Fundamental truths about existence which gives it both texture to [[Consciousness]], as [[Consonance]] and [[Dissonance]].

[[Weight of Purpose]] - Nothing matters, existence is certainty that just happened to be, no inherent meaning yet acquired purpose defines a life, bound to [[Resonance]] and [[Key of Attunement]].

[[Weight of Flaw]] - Everything is imperfect, mortals, existence, gods, it's ontologically impossible, bound to [[Luminance]] and [[Sufficient Precision]].

[[Weight of Indulgence]] - Once tasting a higher reality, is impossible to go back, every new experience a forbidden taste that increases the baseline for conformity and enjoyment, bound to [[Flux]] and [[Emotional Authenticity]].

[[Weight of Value]] - Nothing has inherent value, it all holds to the eye of the beholder, nothing is truly meaningful until [[Consciousness]] decides it is, bound to [[Void]] and [[Essence Sacrifice]].

[[Weight of Nature]] - Everything has an essence that is inescapable, only controllable, whether [[Humanity]], [[Outer God]]s, or the [[Auric Aria]], bound to [[Cindergale]] and [[Perfect Focus]].

[[Weight of Potential]] - The what if of existence, in a parallel of infinite universes, every choice is a murder of probability, bound to [[Crystal]] and [[Absolute Certainty]].

[[Weight of Change]] - Everything will inevitable change, either as an ending or as a different existence. Linked to [[Inevitability of Death]], bound to [[Strand]] and [[Echoing Bonds]].
