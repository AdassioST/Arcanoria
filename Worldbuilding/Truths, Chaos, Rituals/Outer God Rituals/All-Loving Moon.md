A massive construct built by [[Lacrimosa]], also known as the False Moon by the resistance of [[The Hollowing]], with the main purpose of routing [[Consciousness]] into [[Lacrimosa]]. It is suspended several leagues above the sky and aimed to encase the real [[Moon]].

It is a vast celestial object with three main eyes and a hollowed center.
