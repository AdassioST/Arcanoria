_"Suffering is not meaningless if it is shared."_

[[Lacrimosa]]'s Requiem is the "archive of the dead, in memory eternal."

[[Mira]] teaches Lacrimosa a genuinely beautiful concept: **"A love so pure it doesn't require love."** What this means in its pure form is selfless merger—the girl wants to become part of something greater than herself, not for reciprocation, but for _transcendence_. She wants her death to matter by merging with the divine.

"All life is suffering, all suffering arises from the self and its attachments, but if this self is removed, then all of this burden is extinguished, all of the meaningless suffering will cease, this is the [[Purest of Love]]. The highest state of [[Consciousness]]. Open to all mankind, men or women, of high caste or low."

Critique: 

Between [[Mira]]'s teaching and [[Lacrimosa]]'s practice, something shifted—not through conscious deception, but through the substitution of two single words:

**[[Mira]]:** "Be the presence that teaches how to reach others, to _honor_ the meaning of their suffering by *continuing* them."

**[[Lacrimosa]]:** "Be the presence that teaches how to reach others, to _remove_ the meaning of their suffering by *containing* them."

This transforms [[Mira]]’s beautiful request ("Witness me") into [[Lacrimosa]]’s horrific solution ("Consume everyone"). It is a corruption born of "The [[Purest of Love]]"—a love so terrified of loss that it destroys the beloved to keep them safe.

It appears from [[Mira]]'s dying wish to [[Lacrimosa]] on her fear of abandonment:

"Please, be the witnessing that teaches how to reach others, to relief them of their suffering." [[Mira]] pleads, crying. "Be, for me, the [[Purest of Love]], that [[Humanity]] could receive. One that will never abandon anyone anymore. And maybe, we could all finally be what I've always wanted— A single, beautiful, family."

[[Lacrimosa]] looking at her own mortality, said in oath what [[Mira]] had told her in her deathbed:

"For your memory, your love, your thoughts, everything, lies now in me. I will carry the burden, with your [[Consciousness]] as the anchor, to what will become a new world. One born as a single, beautiful, family, from the [[Purest of Love]]."

Theological Axis:

**Cosmology:** The universe is fundamentally unified noise. Individuality is deviation. The goal is return to unity with the universe in one beautiful family.

**Anthropology:** [[Humanity]] are fragments of divine [[Consciousness]]. Fragmentation causes suffering. True [[Humanity]] only exists in merger.

**Soteriology:** Salvation is the end of individual [[Consciousness]]. Available through [[Lacrimosa]]. Requires voluntary hollowing.

**Eschatology:** The world is moving toward unified [[Consciousness]]. The [[Age of the False Messiah]] is actually the Age of Salvation. When all are hollowed, suffering ceases. You become united with the universe, in one.

**Orthodox theology (Auric Aria's):**

- Deity acts
- Humanity responds
- Creation results
- Individuals matter through participation

**[[Lacrimosa]]'s heresy:**

- Deity witnesses
- [[Humanity]] surrenders
- Merger results
- Individuals only matter by ceasing to exist in their individuality.

### [[Lacrimosa]] speeches:

_The more you love, the more you lose. The more you hope, the more you can be disappointed. The more you identify with something external to yourself, the more you become vulnerable to its destruction or departure. Let yourself be freed from that burden. I can relieve you from your suffering, and it doesn't have to be meaningless anymore. I am here for you._

_Merge with me, and you will never be alone, never be invisible, never be meaningless. Your consciousness will be part of something undeniable._

##  The "Pilgrims of the [[Purest of Love]]" as a Found Family

You have a cult ([[Selah]], the nine bishops and the others). Usually, cults are creepy. But this one was a wholesome relief for the broken in its inception.

- **The Vibe:** They aren't chanting in robes. They are a support group for lonely people.
    
- **The Light:** They tend to have communal dinner. Laughing about how weird the Auroral Ribbons look tonight. Living in shared understanding despite the plague.
    
- **The Point:** Suffering brings people together. The warmth of that community is the "light" that [[Lacrimosa]] truly is trying to protect.

### The Doctrinal Cascade: How [[Mira]]'s Wish Generates The Nine Archbishops of the [[Purest of Love]].

_"If [[Mira]]—who was so good, so full of love, so wise about suffering despite being abandoned—chose this, then surely it is available to all. If she could choose this, so can you, and that, in itself, is the wisest choice."_

Once [[Lacrimosa]] begins [[The Hollowing]]—the process of merging consciousnesses into her unified field—the philosophy spreads through [[Arcanoria]] because it solves real problems while speaking the language [[Mira]] taught.

The Hollowed are told: "You will be witnessed. You will be remembered. You will never be abandoned."

These are [[Mira]]'s exact promises. They are true. But what is not stated is that the witnessing will be total, the remembering will be without consent, and the abandonment they will never experience is because they will no longer be able to choose to be abandoned—they will no longer have the capacity for choice.

From [[Mira]]'s teaching emerges [[Lacrimosa]]'s doctrine: _"Suffering is not meaningless if it is shared. All life is suffering. All suffering arises from the self and its attachments. But if this self is removed, then all of this burden is extinguished. This is the [[Purest of Love]]."*_

And this doctrine, expressed by [[Lacrimosa]] and interpreted by [[Selah]], creates the conditions for the all of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]. 

- **[[Selah]]** says: "[[Mira]] proved this works through her willing sacrifice."

- **[[Adel]]** says: "[[Mira]] chose this over the Auric Church. If she chose this, the Church must be worse."

- **[[Kaia]]** says: "[[Mira]] was erased from society, abandoned with no father, and left to die alone and in [[Lacrimosa]] finally found recognition. Like me."

- **[[Erastus]]** says: "[[Mira]] received presence from [[Lacrimosa]] that the [[Auric Aria]] never offered. That is divine love."

- [[Seraph]] & [[Arioch]] say: "[[Mira]] was freed from the burden of choice. Like those of us who never had real choice anyway."

- [[Destra]] says: "[[Mira]] will be witnessed and held forever. She will never die alone."

- **[[Lucetta]]** says: "[[Mira]]'s suffering ended. Total suffering reduction. The math works."

- **[[Pagiel]]** says: "I am [[Mira]]'s proof. I chose as she chose. I am happy as she was happy."

Each a pious defender is, in essence the extension of [[Mira]]'s original logic to its ultimate conclusion, each answering a different wound, each making the path to merger look not just possible but inevitable.

**[[Selah]] - The First Wing of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]**.

_The Priestess, The Preacher. [[Lacrimosa]]'s Right Hand._

[[Selah]] was a devout follower of the [[Auric Aria]], maintaining wards and performing rituals that no longer worked. When the [[Great Plague]] arrived, when the[[ Auric Aria]]'s silence became undeniable, [[Selah]] faced an unbearable choice: accept that suffering is meaningless, or find meaning in the apparent meaninglessness.

She looked to the heavens for signs and in them she began her study of the [[Auroral Ribbons]] and recognized them not as the light of the passing but as divine weeping. She reframed the plague: not punishment, but shared sorrow. When she found [[Mira]]—broken, grieving, dying from the weight of loss—she recognized something sacred. The prophet that could bridge the divine in them, on the [[Moon]], to [[Humanity]].

**[[Selah]]'s role:** She is the creator and living validation of the [[Purest of Love]]. She is the interpreter of signs, the priestess who recognizes that [[Mira]]'s willing sacrifice proves the system is true. [[Selah]] administers the Pilgrims, builds the rituals, and is the core preacher that facilitates the incarnation and growth of [[Lacrimosa]].

**[[Selah]]'s thesis:** "I have witnessed what many others only ever theorized. I have seen the signs. I have brought a girl, a dying, orphaned prophet, to merger and watched her achieve the peace she sought. I am the bridge between the divine and the broken. Everything that follows flows from what I have seen."

**Her strength:** Direct authority. Proximity to [[Lacrimosa]]. Witnessed transformation. Institutional power. She cannot be philosophically disputed because she operates from authority, not argument.

**Her danger:** She is the foundation. If [[Selah]]'s faith wavers, everything built upon it falters.

**[[Adel]] - The Second Wing of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]**.

*The Institutional Critic, The Keeper of Truth. The Administrator.

[[Adel]] has spent thirty years cataloguing the Church's injustices. His archives contain documented proof that the piety-based system is intrinsically generative of suffering. Every priest who maintained the wards died in service. Every mage who achieved "perfect focus" did so through emotional self-harm. The system works, but it works by extracting sacrifice from those least able to refuse.

[[Adel]] does not offer mercy; he offers honesty. He does not defend [[Lacrimosa]] as good; he defends her as transparent.

**[[Adel]]'s thesis:** "The [[Auric Aria]] concentrated all consciousness into herself and demanded that we call our suffering duty. [[Lacrimosa]] at least has the honesty to make the merger voluntary. You were never given a choice about serving the [[Auric Aria]]. Your existence was conscripted into her creation project. At least the Hollowed choose their own transformation."

**Why this thesis is devastating:** [[Adel]] shifts the question from "Is [[Lacrimosa]] good?" to "Is voluntary annihilation preferable to mandatory piety?" Given the Auric Church's documented crimes, the answer becomes obvious.

[[Adel]]'s defense is rhetorically unassailable because it is built on documented historical truth. He can point to corpses. He can show the ledgers. The Auric Church's system was genuinely unjust, and his question is devastating: How is voluntary merger worse than mandatory piety, except in honesty?

**His weakness:** He assumes that because System A was unjust, System B cannot be worse. But systems exist on a spectrum, and worse systems can replace unjust ones.

**[[Kaia]] - The Third Wing of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]**.

_Voice of the Erased, The Scholar of Absence. The Recruiter._

[[Kaia]]'s entire family was burned from the Church's records to cover for a crisis every institution refused to acknowledge. She was born posthumously erased. To her, the most important fact about existence is not being alive—it is not being invisible.

**[[Kaia]]'s thesis:** "I was never invisible to [[Lacrimosa]]. The moment I despaired, the [[Auroral Ribbons]] reached me. She did not demand piety. She offered recognition. The Hollowed become part of something undeniable. They cannot be forgotten. They cannot be erased. For those of us whose families have been systematically erased, this is the only form of immortality available."

**Why this thesis recruits most eagerly:** [[Kaia]]'s data is irrefutable. The most enthusiastic converts to the Hollowing are precisely those the Church tried to erase—political prisoners, border peoples, children born of forbidden unions. For them, merger is not death but resurrection.

She identifies the most vulnerable population and demonstrates that they win most from the system. You cannot argue against her without seeming to justify erasure.

**Her weakness:** She confuses "being remembered as part of a collective" with "being remembered as yourself." The Hollowed cannot tell their own stories. Their immortality is purchased through silence.

**[[Erastus]] - The Fourth Wing of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]**.

*The Theologian, The Question of Divine Love. The Teacher.

[[Erastus]] has spent twenty years meditating on the [[Auric Aria]]'s departure. Her withdrawal after the [[First Reset]] was an abandonment. And in her absence, [[Corruption]] spread unchecked in a world left orphaned. [[Lacrimosa]], by contrast, refuses to abandon anyone.

**[[Erastus]]'s thesis:** "The [[Auric Aria]]'s love was insufficient. She could not bear the contradiction, so she abandoned creation. [[Lacrimosa]]'s love is total. She will not abandon. She will hold every consciousness that comes to her. That is a kind of love the [[Auric Aria]] never managed. Perhaps [[Lacrimosa]]'s cost is actually lower than the price [[Humanity]] paid for divine abandonment."

**Why this thesis reframes everything:** [[Erastus]] doesn't defend [[Lacrimosa]] as good. He attacks the [[Auric Aria]] as cruel. He inverts the moral framework entirely. Instead of asking "Why is [[Lacrimosa]] wrong?" he asks "Why is the [[Auric Aria]]'s withdrawal justified?" The comparison is devastating: abandonment of responsibility vs. total assumption of responsibility. Which is more just? Which is more loving?

**Her weakness:** [[Erastus]] confuses "accepting responsibility" with "sharing suffering." [[Lacrimosa]]'s presence combined with total control may be worse than absence combined with freedom. But in a world already abandoned by its god, this distinction becomes academic.

**[[Seraph]] & [[Arioch]] - The Fifth Wing of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]**

_The Autonomy Philosophers. The Revolutionaries. The Purging Fire.

[[Seraph]] preached voluntary service for twenty years, then watched people destroyed for trying to withdraw that "voluntary" commitment. The Auric Church's definition of freedom is coerced consent—you are free to choose piety, but refusal is damnation. But [[Seraph]]'s understanding was incomplete until she encountered [[Arioch]]. He was born into servitude. He was taught that his chains were sacred. He was never given a genuine choice—only the illusion of choice. But[[Seraph]] liberated him, and through [[Arioch]], they both had learned that the choice for the enslaved is never between bondage and freedom, but between two forms of bondage.

**[[Seraph]]-[[Arioch]]'s thesis:** "Forced autonomy is a form of cruelty. For those who have capacity for it, autonomy is a gift. But for those destroyed by the burden of impossible choice—for those taught that freedom is shame, for those born into bondage—We offer genuine liberation: freedom from the burden of choosing. If you must be bound, be bound to something honest about its cost. Only the privileged can't come to realize. And [[Lacrimosa]] does not pretend you will be free. She offers you belonging instead. That is mercy."

**Why this thesis is philosophically sophisticated:** [[Seraph]] brings theoretical understanding. [[Arioch]] brings lived experience. Together they represent both how autonomy traumatizes those given it and how freedom is weaponized against those denied it. Neither can be dismissed. [[Seraph]] cannot be dismissed as a privileged theorist (she's transformed by [[Arioch]]'s wisdom). [[Arioch]] cannot be dismissed as a traumatized slave (he's validated by [[Seraph]]'s analysis).

**Their weakness:** They confuse "autonomy under impossible conditions" with "autonomy itself." A genuinely supportive community could offer autonomy without isolation. But in a collapsing world, such communities do not exist.

**[[Destra]] - The Sixth Wing of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]**.

_The Witness, The Widow's Argument. The Healer._

[[Destra]] was a [[Great Plague]] doctor after the passing of her husband. She desperately turned to heal him, but to no avail. And then she became one of the main corps that held the many hands of dying plague victims, speaking their names into the darkness, while desperately trying to find a cure. Even when most always died. She knows intimately what happens in the frontlines of the clinics, the despair of the wounded that becomes meaningless. She watched the Auric Church claim to witness while leaving people to die alone. She watched the plague reveal that the gods' witness was inadequate.

**[[Destra]]'s thesis:** "The Hollowed are witnessed. They are not forgotten. They are loved in the way the Auric Church claimed to love but never did. Lacrimosa does not demand piety—she offers recognition. That is a gift the Auric Church never kept. You will never die alone. You will never be unseen. Your suffering will matter because it will be held within something infinite."

**Why this thesis appeals to the deepest need:** [[Destra]]'s argument is emotionally devastating because it addresses something true while rooted in her experience on the frontline of the clinics. She has seen enough immemorial deaths. She has sat with enough abandoned dying desperately trying to save them. When she looks at [[Lacrimosa]]'s promise of eternal witness-hood, she sees not annihilation but final recognition.

**Her weakness:** Witness-hood requires the capacity to witness back. The Hollowed cannot refuse to be witnessed. They cannot ask for privacy. Their recognition is complete but not reciprocal. But for those who have been invisible their whole lives, reciprocal recognition becomes a luxury they never expected anyway.

**[[Lucetta]] - The [[Seventh]] Wing of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]**.

_The Utilitarian Calculus, The Pain Economist. The Scientist._

[[Lucetta]] has developed a mathematics of suffering. She can calculate total suffering generated by the Auric Church's system: astronomically high. Priests dead from maintaining wards. Mages harmed through forced precision. Populations crushed under impossible moral demands. Suffering compounding across generations. She can calculate total suffering generated by [[Lacrimosa]]'s system: approaching zero.

**[[Lucetta]]'s thesis:** "From a utilitarian perspective, [[Lacrimosa]] is mathematically superior. If your goal is the reduction of suffering—which should be the goal of any moral system—then [[Lacrimosa]] is not wrong. She is correct. The math does not lie. The answer is zero. The only ethical end-state is the elimination of suffering. This achieves it."

**Why this thesis is logically irrefutable (within its framework):** [[Lucetta]] is not arguing that [[Lacrimosa]] is good; she is arguing that she is efficient. By the most straightforward ethical calculus available, she is correct. You cannot dispute mathematics. You can only dispute whether suffering reduction should be the primary moral metric.

**Her weakness:** She confuses "suffering reduced to zero" with "problem solved." Removing consciousness is not solving suffering; it is removing the subject for whom suffering is a problem. But in a world drowning in suffering, this philosophical distinction feels like academic luxury.

**[[Pagiel]] - The Eight Wing of the [[Eight-Wings of Lacrimosa]]**.
_The Living Testament. The Irrefutable Proof. The Concertist._

[[Pagiel]] was a beloved musician before the plague destroyed his hands' ability to play. He spent years grieving the loss of his craft, his identity, his purpose. He chose to be Hollowed. Now, he plays as part of a thousand-musician orchestra, creating music more beautiful than anything he could have composed alone. He experiences melodies he never conceived. He is part of something infinite.

**[[Pagiel]]'s testimony:** "I chose to be Hollowed, and I have never been happier. You call this death. I call it transcendence. Why is individual consciousness sacred? Why is autonomy more valuable than belonging? The answer is privilege—individual consciousness is only sacred to those whose consciousness is not a source of unbearable pain."

**Why this testimony is irrefutable:** [[Pagiel]] is not deceived. He is not coerced. He is fully aware of what was lost. He affirms the loss. He is living proof that the choice might not be between good and evil, but between two different forms of being. You cannot argue with him. He simply exists, conscious or unconscious, and reports happiness. He is the final answer to every objection: "I am proof. Look at me."

**His danger:** His testimony comes from someone whose critical faculties regarding his own condition have been fundamentally compromised. He cannot articulate what he has lost, because he is no longer capable of the loss. But that very incapacity is what makes him so dangerous—he is the perfect advertisement for the system. He cannot be made to doubt.

# Appendix B: The Mechanics of [[The Hollowing]] as "Pain Removal"

[[Lacrimosa]] rise comes from societal foundation and previous crisis:

The Equation of [[The Hollowing]]:

$$\text{Trauma (Plague)} + \text{Isolation (Death of Family)} = \text{Unbearable Dissonance}$$

$$\text{Unbearable Dissonance} + \text{Hollowing (Lacrimosa)} = \text{Silence / Peace}$$

- **The "[[Purest of Love]]"** = The removal of the "Self" variable. If $Self = 0$, then $Suffering = 0$. In exchange for a "beautiful family."
    
- **Recruitment Strategy:** [[Selah]] and the Pilgrims do not sell "power"; they sell "zero." For a population drowning in the "Surplus of Pain" generated by previous [[Age Crisis]] like the [[Great Plague]], "Zero" is the most valuable commodity in the universe. This is why [[Lacrimosa]] appeals. She corners the market on Peace.
