#scorchingtruth 

A [[Scorching Truth]] that happened in the [[Seventh Cycle]] where [[Humanity]] was born from the betrayal of [[Selenea]] by the [[Auric Aria]] to steal her power of breathing vitality and create beings in the [[Auric Aria]]'s [[Perfect Reflection]].

This act created the first [[Celestial Ensnaring Mirror]] which is now the [[Moon]] with a bound [[Selenea]] as central power of the [[Leylines]] in [[Arcanoria]].
