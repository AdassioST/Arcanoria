#story 

[[Gayviene]] sits alone at the wind-swept balcony of a ruined observatory in [[Hollowmarch]], watching the moon through a fractured glass lens. His familiar, [[Scrap]], paces beside him restlessly. [[Gayviene]] has just witnessed the destructive consequences of one of his divinations—a future he foresaw and spoke aloud, which became inevitable because of his intervention. The sense of moral dissolution hangs heavy.​

[[Gayviene]]: _(voice almost a whisper)_  
"When does seeing the path become forcing it into being? When does the truth I speak become the cage I build? Am I a seer or an architect of futures that should have passed by undisturbed?"

[[Scrap]]: _(quiet, concerned, places a paw on Gayviene’s boot)_

[[Gayviene]]: "Do you think truth will free us? They called it a gift. But each vision I cast becomes iron in the world. I wanted to save them, [[Scrap]]—I wanted to be their guide. But when does the candle of hope I light become the blaze that consumes everything in its wake?"

He stands, knuckles white on the cold railing, voice quavering.

[[Gayviene]]:
"When does clarity become obsession? When does prophecy become prescription? I remember faintly the prayer the wizard sang—  
_"Wisdom before clarity becomes cruelty."_'
Is this what she meant, [[Scrap]]? Is this how we turn?"

[[Scrap]]: _(chitters gently, nuzzles his hand, eyes mournful)_

[[Gayviene]]: _(to himself, in tears threatening)_  
"Each answer I give them, they build upon—each future I foresee, they cannot escape. I see their terror. And I see—my hand in it."

He sinks to his knees, moonbeam crossing his face. The quiet rush of [[Hollowmarch]] below, both peaceful and charged.

[[Gayviene]]: "Tell me, friend—when does the desire to keep them safe become the urge to keep them controlled? If I knew this is the poison I was warned about all those years ago."

_(He shuts his eyes)_

[[Gayviene]]:
"When does the love that makes me weave become the thread that strangles everything I wish to save?"
