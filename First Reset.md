The first canonical [[Civilization Reset]].

After the [[Lost Cycle]], the return of the [[Auric Aria]] and before the first [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]] and the [[Second Reset]].

It is the state of the world before the start of the game where the [[Auric Aria]] was collaborating a lot with [[Humanity]]. She came to realize the dependency [[Humanity]] developed for her and with the eventual [[Great Fracture]], she decided to now remain in silence.

Only [[The White-Touched Archivist]] is from the original timeline.

It is a [[Scorching Truth]] until the [[Auric Aria]] reveals it during the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]] of the [[Great Fracture]] in the [[Second Reset]]. While it is referenced before, the confirmation only happens after the [[Civilization]] knows [[The Truth of Arcanoria]].
