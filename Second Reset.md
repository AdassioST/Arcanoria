The second canon [[Civilization Reset]] and start of the game.

The start of the game is hidden within the timeline as it is after the [[First Reset]] and the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]] of the [[Great Fracture]]. It begins with the [[Age of Desolation]] and is characterized by the minimum intervention of the [[Auric Aria]].

The climax of the second reset always leads to a [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]] bad ending, but it comes with realizing [[The Truth of Arcanoria]], and the revealing cinematic of the [[True Mythos of Creation]].

The merge of realities allows [[Crisis Wonders]] to appear as "historical anomalies" where massive constructions appear of no historical period that matches its design. They're like the pyramids being instead beacons to signal. No one can explain these constructions as they're not from the original timeline and they accumulate on each reset.
