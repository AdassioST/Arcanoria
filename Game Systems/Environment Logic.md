This system is in charge of registering all the changes to the world that may pass through [[Cycle]]. The primary ticking pattern for handling in-game logic and the passage of time is the Time System Logic which uses [[Seventh]] as the minimum unit, handling 21 [[Seventh]] per [[Phase]]. 3 [[Phase]] per [[Echo]] and 4 [[Echo]] per [[Cycle]]. 

The Time Logic System handles a total of the following per [[Cycle]]:
- 252 [[Seventh]].
- 12 [[Phase]].
- 4 [[Echo]].

The weather effects related to each [[Echo]] like "Winter" themed coming in the [[Echo of Silence]] are applied by the Environment Logic and it affects [[Production Units]], as well as [[Events]]. Making it harder to survive through this period.
