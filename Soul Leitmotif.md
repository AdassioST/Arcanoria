#spellweaving

The essence of self imbued with the primary element from [[The Principles of Magic]] that any [[Spellweaver]] has. It requires a [[Motif Awakening]] to manifest and is the primary source of [[Music as Catalyst]] for casting magic.

It starts with the primary element imbued from the [[Motif Awakening]]. However, it can receive up to two [[Ornaments]] with enough [[Spellweaving]] mastery and new [[Motif Awakening]]s. Making the [[Spellweaver]] develop attunement and specialization in any other two elements aside from their primary.

*Virtually the same as a vision in Genshin*
