Dormant [[Soul Leitmotif]]: [[Resonance]].
[[Ornament]]s: [[Crystal]], [[Flux]].

The essence of self imbued with the primary element from [[The Principles of Magic]] that any [[Spellweaver]] has. It requires a [[Motif Awakening]] to manifest and is the primary source of [[Music as Catalyst]] for [[Spellweaving]].

It starts with the primary element imbued from the [[Motif Awakening]]. However, it can receive up to two [[Ornament]]s with enough [[Spellweaving]] mastery and new [[Motif Awakening]]s. Making the [[Spellweaver]] develop attunement and specialization in any other two elements aside from their primary.

### [[Consciousness]] bound in a [[Soul-Key]] gem

A [[Soul Leitmotif]] is the [[Fundamental Frequency]] gem, a physical crystallization of a [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Soul-Key]]. Their unique vibrational signature made tangible through a [[Motif Awakening]]. The gem is not merely a container of magic but the actual manifestation of their [[Consciousness]] externalized, containing both their essence, memories and soul.

It is a single physical object of mutable shape that reconfigures physically between multiple forms depending on context and need. Likewise, the aesthetic visuals of the gem represents the primary binding and its [[Ornament]]s in the following configuration:

- Primary Color ([[Soul Leitmotif]]): The gem's core color matching the [[Spellweaver]]'s signature element. It defines both the icon and primary color of the [[Fundamental Frequency]] gem. This is the dominant visual identifier.
- Primary [[Ornament]] (Veinwork Color): Fine, branching veinwork runs through the gem's interior like rutile needles or mineral dendrites, manifesting in the complementary color to the primary element.
- Secondary [[Ornament]]: The casing color of the metallic framing surrounding the gem, typically silver by default.

The colors of the elements are the following:

- [[Resonance]]: Bright green to teal luminescence.
- [[Luminance]]: Pure white-to-pale-yellow glow.
- [[Flux]]: Deep, shifting varieties of blue.
- [[Void]]: Purple and shadow with black undertones.
- [[Cindergale]]: Warm orange to crimson ember-glow.
- [[Crystal]]: Pink, prismatic radiance that splits light into rainbow fractals.
- [[Strand]]: Braided gold that seems to move across the surface.

### The Three States of a [[Soul Leitmotif]]

The [[Fundamental Frequency]] gem exists in three distinct operational states, each reflecting a different level of magical engagement, emotional intensity, and deployment context. Understanding these states is crucial to comprehending how [[Arcanoria]]'s magic functions — from intimate, daily practice to catastrophic, reality-altering bursts of power.

**Dormant State (The Resting Egg) | [[Consciousness]] as Magic

The dormant state is a [[Soul Leitmotif]]'s true resting condition, it's the baseline existence usually kept in a sacred space or shrine, in this state it is something treasured and protected rather than openly worn.

It's physical state resembles a teardrop-shaped ovoid approximately 5-10 cm in length encased in metallic framing matching the secondary [[Ornament]], pulsing gently with the [[Spellweaver]]'s [[Fundamental Frequency]] in a rhythm reminiscent of their heartbeat. Dormant gems are usually kept in sacred spaces, personal shrines, altars, or in intimate possessions. They serve as spiritual anchors treasured as extensions of the self. A dormant gem can't be lost, they appear next to their [[Spellweaver]]s once they pass a certain threshold of distance.

**Wearable State (The Accessory) | Control as Mastery

Wearable [[Soul Leitmotif]]: [[Void]] as a spherical pendant on a choker.
[[Ornament]]s: [[Strand]], [[Flux]].

The most common state of a [[Soul Leitmotif]] as this is the active configuration that a [[Spellweaver]] integrates into their outfit, making it a catalyst for [[Spellweaving]]. It's the state during normal life and combat preparation. 

**Transformation Mechanics:** The transition from dormant to wearable is intentional and conscious, triggered when the [[Spellweaver]] decides they need active magical access. The process takes 2-5 seconds as the gem's atomic structure becomes semi-fluid, rearranging to integrate into jewelry or clothing.

The metallic casing flows like mercury, reshaping around the gem as it elongates, flattens, or reconfigures. The casing reforms and bonds molecularly to clothing, fabric or a chosen jewelry piece. The gem becomes part of the outfit rather than merely attached to it.

**Wearable Forms:** The gem can take numerous configurations depending on cultural tradition and tactical need. All forms maintain the same color encoding (primary color core, complementary-color veins, casing-color framing):

- Head/Face: Circlet, tiara, hairpin, ear cuff, eyepiece/monocle.
- Neck/Chest: Pendant, choker, brooch, collar clasp.
- Arms/Hands: Ring, bracelet, arm band, glove ornament.
- Torso/Waist: Belt buckle, sash ornament, corset centerpiece.
- Legs/Feet: Anklet, thigh band, boot ornament.

Likewise, the wearable state is maintained during combat or high-stress situations signaling specific properties because:

- It maintains constant [[Consonance]] with the [[Great Harmonic Loom]].
- It allows quick access to [[Major Note]]s without pausing for meditation.
- It's visible and intimidating — potential threats recognize the glowing gem as a magical threat.

If the [[Spellweaver]]'s emotional state becomes inauthentic or conflicted during [[Spellweaving]], the gem flickers or dims as a warning that one of [[The Principles of Magic]] is degrading. This prevents spell completion and is the visual cue that invites [[Discordant Interference]]. 

As for endurance, most [[Spellweaver]]s can maintain a wearable state indefinitely. However, the intensity of the spells and the magical fatigue manifest physically as the gem to becomes hot to the touch and its glow erratic. At this point, the [[Spellweaver]] must transition back to dormant state to allow recharge, if they still refuse to stop they're likely to pass out from the strain they're putting in their [[Consciousness]]. Recovery time usually takes 1-2 hours of rest but it can be increased by the magical fatigue debt of [[Spellweaving]] beyond exhaustion.

**[[Awakened State]] (The Critical Manifestation) | Emotion as Fuel

[[Awakened State]] [[Soul Leitmotif]]: [[Flux]] sympathetic rings from a [[Crystal]] construct.
Orbiting [[Ornament]]s: [[Crystal]], [[Luminance]] in polyhedron geometry and arcs of light.

[[Awakened State]] [[Soul Leitmotif]]: [[Luminance]] searing light star-like core cocoon.
Orbiting [[Ornament]]s: [[Flux]], [[Strand]] with tidal currents flowing in time bending.

The last and most powerful state of the [[Soul Leitmotif]] occurs only during the [[Catalytic Abyss of Emotion]]. This is the gem's most powerful and most terrifying state. It only occurs when a [[Spellweaver]]'s feeling reaches such intensity that it breaks through the [[Great Harmonic Loom]]'s normal amplitude limits, creating waves that cascade through multiple threads simultaneously.

This state requires an authentic catalyst, no amount of forced or acted emotion can trigger an [[Awakened State]]. This is why it is rare and most [[Spellweaver]]'s never experience it, but those who do are forever changed by it. It is different from a [[Motif Awakening]] because it can only occur after a [[Spellweaver]] has unlocked both of their [[Ornament]]s and has mastery over their primary binding. It follow a similar logic for activation yet instead of triggering a new [[Motif Awakening]] and giving a purpose, it is a visceral present state that creates an impossible state of [[Superposed Resonance]] where the gem responds catastrophically, regardless of its current form. Its atomic structure becomes unstable as it cannot contain the flow of emotion happening.

The sequence of activation is the following:
1. Veinwork Ignition (0.3 - 3.5 seconds): The [[Soul Leitmotif]] veins erupt with luminescent fury. Barely visible inclusions become the lightning-bright channels of pure elemental energy burning from the gem's interior, branching fractally as power seeks every pathway.
2. Gem Expansion and Rupture (3.5-5 seconds): The gem undergoes catastrophic transformation, growing 3-5x its original size as it ruptures from its contained form. It becomes a raw, jagged levitating elemental matter, pulsing with searing intensity that changes shape based on the primary binding element of the original [[Soul Leitmotif]].
3. Elemental Outburst (5-7 seconds): The awakened gem erupts a massive elemental aura, creating visible environmental effects and a field of distortion around the [[Spellweaver]] based on their element.
4. Spell Manifestation and Cascading Collateral Damage (7+ seconds):
5. Collapse and Aftermath (On ending of [[Awakened State]]):
