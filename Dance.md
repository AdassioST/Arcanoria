#spellweaving 

While not a main instrument, dancing helps existing songs to create dance of battle movements which couple well with physical weapons.

This is the "melee" archetype of [[Spellweaving]]. It requires either someone else playing a [[Primary Instrument]] or the [[Spellweaver]] to master the ability to play and instrument or use their [[Own Voice]] while casting spells and while battling, a great example is [[Skarr Karmelita]].
