*Weave your destiny in [[The Eternal Symphony]] of [[Arcanoria]]*

### 🎶Premise

After the [[Great Fracture]], the once-thriving world of [[Arcanoria]] lies in ruin. Civilization collapsed into scattered remains, haunted by the echoes of a lost glory in a world adrift between renewal and decay — a true [Moldy World](https://youtu.be/iHSEFMYjbnE?si=MBvIikI93Pd_QOV9). 

At the heart of existence flows [[The First Overtone]], and the [[Auric Aria]], the god of [[Humanity]], divided its flow through the [[Auric Heptacode]] into two primordial forces: [[Aetherlight]], radiant and nostalgic, and [[Moonshine]], dreamlike and delirious. Their waning glow seeps through the shattered skies, shaping every shadow, forest, and crumbling gothic spire.

Magic in [[Arcanoria]] emerges from [[Resonance]], as emotions ripple through the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] with [[Music as Catalyst]], dance, and song. Every note carries intention, every rhythm bends reality. Yet each spell is fragile, bound to the presence of [[The First Overtone]] and tainted by its dual nature.

Embark on an odyssey of the [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]], navigating through [[Cycle]] of scarcity and resurgence. As epochs unfold, you must rebuild society, steward resources, and navigate faith, corruption, loyalty, and societal development with each choice echoing across generations, shaping anew the fragile rebirth of the world in [[The Eternal Symphony]] of light and shadow.

*It is the Birthright of every Empire to Die. Ascend in harmony with the fractured symphony, and fade into obscurity after the last song goes silent*

### Backlog Ideas

- Preconception the Movie as a reference for an intersex god that gets pregnant with itself and its son is the god. It causes a time crystal, a paradox where it is both the son, the mother, and the father in an infinite ouroboros cycle.
