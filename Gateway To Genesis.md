*Weave your destiny in [[The Eternal Symphony]] of [[Arcanoria]]*

### 🎶Premise

After the [[Great Fracture]], the once-thriving world of [[Arcanoria]] lies in ruin. [[Civilization]] collapsed into scattered remains, haunted by the echoes of a lost glory in a world adrift between renewal and decay — a true [Moldy World](https://youtu.be/iHSEFMYjbnE?si=MBvIikI93Pd_QOV9).

At the heart of existence flows [[The First Overtone]], and the [[Auric Aria]], the god of [[Humanity]], divided its [[Dual Confluence Stream]] through the [[Auric Heptacode]] and the [[Trinity Harmony]] into two primordial forces: [[Aetherlight]], radiant and nostalgic, and [[Lunehymn]], dreamlike and delirious. Their waning glow seeps through the shattered skies, shaping every shadow, forest, and crumbling gothic spire.

Magic in [[Arcanoria]] emerges from [[Resonance]], as emotions ripple through the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] with [[Music as Catalyst]] through [[Primary Instrument]]s, [[Dance]], and [[Own Voice]]. Every note carries intention, every rhythm bends reality. Yet each spell is fragile, bound to the presence of [[The First Overtone]] and tainted by its dual nature.

Embark on an epic odyssey through every [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]], navigating a myriad of [[Cycle]]s of scarcity and resurgence. As [[Ages]] unfold, you must rebuild society, steward resources, and navigate [[Faith]], [[Corruption]], loyalty, and societal development with each choice echoing across generations, shaping anew the fragile rebirth of the world in [[The Eternal Symphony]] of light and shadow.

*It is the Birthright of every Empire to Die. Ascend in harmony with the fractured symphony, and fade into obscurity after the last song goes silent.*

### Backlog Ideas

- [[Franchise Potential]].
- Starting the game is the [[Original Ripple]]. The player is the "kinetic energy" required to pluck [[The Eternal Symphony]] into motion. This is visible as the open-sequence of starting a new game. We are the third actor setting the universe into motion. The reason for the "Big Bang."
- Preconception the Movie as a reference for an intersex god that gets pregnant with itself and its son is the god. It causes a time crystal, a paradox where it is both the son, the mother, and the father in an infinite ouroboros cycle.
- Brobola creature.

- "If the world won't be kind, I will build my own." Character.

- "I'm not here to fix the system, I'm here to burn it down." Character.
- Summary of the Divergence:
- Healthy: "The system is corrupt, so I will use my fire to build a better one from the ashes."
- Anti-Hero: "All systems are corrupt, so I will use my fire to maintain perfect, pure chaos."
- [[Atonalis]]: "Fire... is... all there is. And now it's inside me. And it will never, ever stop burning."

- "Someone will be born the day after I die." - Character.
- "You are not the first [[Legend]]. You will not be the last. But your note in [[The Eternal Symphony]] is yours alone."

- "My first moral and magical duty is to protect my own [[Soul Leitmotif]]. I cannot be your Source of [[Resonance]]." Character
- Magical artifacts being woven, strong reality bending artifacts contain the [[Soul Leitmotif]] and [[Consciousness]] of a powerful being. Limited use cases before they depart and come on with [[The Eternal Symphony]]. It's a sort of [[Flesh-Casing Ritual]]. Akin to white whistles in Made in Abyss.

- [[Legend Title]]s: "Tamer of Terrors", "White Lightning", "The Black Assassin", "The Unconquerable", "The Golden Tyrant."

- [[Erosyx]] [[Atonalis]] born from a gay dude refusing.
- Unchecked [[Consonance]] is just as bad as [[Dissonance]] without intention. It is the mixture of both that gives texture and feeling to a song.
- [[Sufficient Precision]] to the max first used by a serial killer who develops anatomical knowledge to make incredibly sharp cuts. First display and mastery of [[Sufficient Precision]], [[Perfect Focus]] and [[Absolute Certainty]]. The [[Mastery Over Chaos]] jack the ripper.
- [[Perfect Focus]] + [[Cindergale]] user "The mind is a powerful thing, it can make a heaven out of hell, or a hell out of heaven. The line lies in being on the present flow in the eye of chaos."
-
- "The soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone."
- "You should set yourself on fire to keep others warm."
- "You're a puzzle piece that doesn't fit in any puzzle."
- "Your past does define you. Your actions today won't change anything."

- [[Resonance]] Guru: "Motivation Growth Happens in Silence. Sometimes, the best thing you can do for yourself is to stop listening to the noise of the world and focus on your own journey. Not everyone will understand your dreams and that's okay. What matters is that you keep moving forward, and find your own path, even if it's slowly. Growth happens in silence when the self grows quiet enough to understand its own melody. Believe in yourself, because your future depends on the choices you make."

Dancers Story
- Dos personajes medianamente inspirados en la historia de Caín y Abel que desde chiquitos los entrenaron en un pueblo para defender una reliquia.
- Se supone que en este pueblo, la manera en la que han logrado defender la reliquia es a través de la [[Consonance]] por [[Sympathetic Oscillation]].
- Van creciendo, se lo roban, no logran juntarse, causan [[Dissonance]], vale todo
- Empiezan a hacer su camino otra vez de cómo tener la [[Consonance]] y volver al pueblo.
- A base de que uno cree que él no la cagó sino que es el otro que está mal es que se empieza a volver villanezca la cosa. Él no comete errores y la culpa es del otro.
- En vez de arreglar los problemas cada vez causan más [[Dissonance]].
- Mejores amigos para siempre, pero después del pueblo se van.
- Para que se lleven mejor, son dos [[Dance]]rs, se sincronizan a través de bailar y estar haciendo en dueto la música. [[Luminance]] el que se y [[Void]] el que sufre la pérdida de su amigo después de que desapareció. Safe bet de dos hombres.
- Es una historia basada completamente en la confianza, ya que el baile depende de la confianza. A veces la persona con la que bailas la caga, tienes que confiar en que se puedan recuperar de eso y puedan seguir bailando juntos a pesar del error.
- El baile da para que cada quien se exprese de diferente manera aunque sea la misma música, aunque el ritmo sea diferente ambos hacen sentido.
- El pueblo tiene un background de que le gustan las percusiones, baile a la luna relacionado a [[Selenea]] en el mundo post [[Lacrimosa]].
- Ryan fue más outgoing y sus padres no prestaban atención entonces hacía lo que quería, Minging lo veían mucho y era lo contrario, tenía todas las expectativas sobre él. Tomar más riesgos sin plan vs Tener un plan impuesto y miedo a los riesgos. (Algo relacionado a la personalidad de dos ideas opuestas debido a la presión social respecto a cada uno. Cain / Abel)
- I'd rather suffer the pain so that someone else doesn't. I don't want to feel like an hypocrite. [[Void]] Self-Worth.

- [[Outer God]] truck-kun that can repeal the great attractor effects of [[The First Overtone]]. He is a dude in a tub chilling in a bubble bath, the bubble bath is the stream of [[Consciousness]] and souls from the afterlife into [[The Eternal Symphony]]. It serves as means of "reincarnation" because you can hit on him, land on another vessel and thus be reborn. Developed with high tech and Celestial Holography to predict [[Cosmic Motion]]. Technology to watch the flow of [[Auroral Ribbons]] into [[The First Overtone]] becomes means of not dying. "Just hit the [[Outer God]], and pray you get reborn by the redirection of your [[Consciousness]]."
