**Dark Fantasy • 4X • Incremental Strategy • Clicker + RTS hybrid
*Weave your destiny in [[The Eternal Symphony]] of [[Arcanoria]]*

### 🎶Premise

After the [[Great Fracture]], the once-thriving world of [[Arcanoria]] lies in ruin. Civilization collapsed into scattered remains, haunted by the echoes of a lost glory in a world adrift between renewal and decay — a true [Moldy World](https://youtu.be/iHSEFMYjbnE?si=MBvIikI93Pd_QOV9). 

At the heart of existence flows [[The First Overtone]], and the [[Auric Aria]], the god of [[Humanity]], divided its flow through the [[Auric Heptacode]] and the [[Trinity Harmony]] into two primordial forces: [[Aetherlight]], radiant and nostalgic, and [[Lunehymn]], dreamlike and delirious. Their waning glow seeps through the shattered skies, shaping every shadow, forest, and crumbling gothic spire.

Magic in [[Arcanoria]] emerges from [[Resonance]], as emotions ripple through the [[Great Harmonic Loom]] with [[Music as Catalyst]], dance, and song. Every note carries intention, every rhythm bends reality. Yet each spell is fragile, bound to the presence of [[The First Overtone]] and tainted by its dual nature.

Embark on an epic odyssey through every [[Cataclysmic Aftermath]], navigating a myriad of [[Cycle]]s of scarcity and resurgence. As [[Ages]] unfold, you must rebuild society, steward resources, and navigate [[Faith]], [[Corruption]], loyalty, and societal development with each choice echoing across generations, shaping anew the fragile rebirth of the world in [[The Eternal Symphony]] of light and shadow.

*It is the Birthright of every Empire to Die. Ascend in harmony with the fractured symphony, and fade into obscurity after the last song goes silent.*

### Backlog Ideas

- Preconception the Movie as a reference for an intersex god that gets pregnant with itself and its son is the god. It causes a time crystal, a paradox where it is both the son, the mother, and the father in an infinite ouroboros cycle.
- Brobola creature.
- "If the world won't be kind, I will build my own." Character.

- "I'm not here to fix the system, I'm here to burn it down." Character.
- Summary of the Divergence:
- Healthy: "The system is corrupt, so I will use my fire to build a better one."
- Anti-Hero: "All systems are corrupt, so I will use my fire to maintain perfect, pure chaos."
- [[Atonalis]]: "Fire... is... all there is. And now it's inside me. And it will never, ever stop burning."

- "My first moral and magical duty is to protect my own [[Soul Leitmotif]]. I cannot be your Source of [[Resonance]]." Character
- Magical artifacts being woven, strong reality bending artifacts contain the [[Soul Leitmotif]] and [[Consciousness]] of a powerful being. Limited use cases before they depart and come on with [[The Eternal Symphony]]. It's a sort of [[Flesh-Casing Ritual]]. Akin to white whistles in Made in Abyss.
- Titles: "Tamer of Terrors",
- [[Erosyx]] [[Atonalis]] born from a gay dude refusing.

- Monster Hunter
- Witcher
- Planet Zoo
