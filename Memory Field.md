An advanced type of a [[Strand Pool]] mirroring as an archeomagical [[Strand]] field that contain the weight of history for a strong event. It's the result of [[Echoing Bonds]] imprinted on the place of occurrence.

It exhibits similar properties to that of a [[Strand Pool]]:

- Temporal Distortion: Time flows irregularly, a visitor can feel the experience of hours passing yet emerge to find only minutes have passed, or vice versa.

- [[Object Blueprint]] Permanence: They maintain a blueprint of historical data of how something, someone, or somewhere used to be in the past.

However, [[Memory Field]]s are [[Strand Pool]]s strong enough to be outside the [[Trinity Harmony]]'s normal temporal current, being looped instead with the specific moment its standing-wave crystalized into [[Resonance]].

They also preserve an oddly quiet aura with only a gentle wind that filters all exterior sound. Such is the primary indicator that the [[Strand Pool]] is a [[Memory Field]]. This phenomenon occurs due to the time-dilated presence of static of [[Primal White Noise]], nullifying most of the outside [[Resonance]], and preserving only a muted atmosphere of the historical event.

Surprisingly, [[Memory Field]]s are sites of high [[Coherence]], even if the surrounding environment is filled with [[Static Criticality]] or [[Dissonance]], they're the very "eye of the hurricane" for magic.

### Canon [[Memory Field]]s:

Depending on the [[Ages]] some [[Memory Field]]s appear in [[Arcanoria]] as specific spots within the map. All the list considers:

- Unnamed Harbor: The ruined version of [[Lune Shallow]] after [[A Pact of a Thousand-Eyes]] has been completed and [[The Hollowing]] begins. It contains the story of [[Mira]] and the [[Ballad]] of the Girl Left Behind.

- [[The Silent Expanse]] Epicenter: Atop the cliff where [[The Auric Aria's Sacrifice]] happened in the first field of [[Forsaken Flower]]s. It contains the story of the [[Eighth Cycle]] and the truth about the [[Auric Aria]] descent.
